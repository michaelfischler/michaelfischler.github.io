 <michael> Now's your chance nate
 <michael> Get em while they're cheap 
 <michael> The average asking price for desirable dogs — those with lionlike manes and thick limbs — is hovering around $2,000, though many desperate breeders are willing to go far lower.
 <michael> From 200 - 250,000 
 <michael> To 2,000 
 <michael> Such a deal 
 <vance> U have to nate
 <vance> What u guys up to

 <peter> So just pep I guess
 <nina> I'll do half cheese and half pepperoni 
 <jacob> A pep a cheese.
 <nina> I probably can't guarantee that
 <nina> How hungry are you guys gonna be? Should I get the 12pc garlic knots too?
 <nina> Kkkkk
 <hunter> Okay my brethren you shall return to my domain 
 <vance> Hurrah
 <peter> Ok my man 
 <peter> Jay can u get mike
 <jacob> Roger
 <hunter> He's here 
 <jacob> o
 <peter> 5k done 
 <michael>  I have written poetry 
 <michael> To express my current state 
 <michael> Titled "Morning after delirium"
 <michael> My stomach feels like the pits of hell blackened with grease, cigarettes, whiskey, and a night of over indulgence | God help me | The enjoyment of today was drained for the brief pleasure that was last night | But yet let me lament with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts that our stars, irreconcilable, should divide our equalness to this | I am left with but one choice | Oft desired | But to forgo my misgivings, | Pray for forgiveness and water
 <hunter> Wow that was great 
 <nina> I don't even know if that poem is positive or negative 
 <hunter> Haha how you doing Nate? You seems hella sconed last night 
 <jacob> Ügh
 <hunter> Haha all of you for that matter how you all feellin
 <vance> I indulged the max to still be able to function 2day
 <vance> Carefully calculated 
 <jacob> Michaels poem applies to me too
 <vance> I went to sleep pretty early compared to other weekends
 <vance> At 1
 <peter> Same 
 <vance> Trying to figure out my lunch situation 
 <vance> Is today one of those days when you wake up at a relatively normal time
 <vance> Then go back to sleep at like 3
 <vance> And become nocturnal
 <michael> my body demands rest 
 <michael> despite my current energy 
 <michael> it is punishing me for staying awake for 2 days 
 <michael> I feel the clammy grasp of death 
 <vance> Go to it mike
 <michael> tugging me every so softly 
 <vance> Do not fight
 <vance> Let it happen
 <michael> into the depths 
 <michael> to fight this would be to fight existence 
 <michael> after deleting half my brain cells last night 
 <michael> and excasterbating my state with a myriad of drugs 
 <michael> i have risen from the ashes 
 <michael> with creativity and eloquence aplenty 
 <michael> i am at my peak
 <michael> the peak of my writing capability 
 <michael> today I will write the next great american novel 
 <michael> My lust for life restored 
 <jacob> gay

 <jacob> 3 AM MUSK by "Seansjeans" Combs-Daddy
 <michael> Dang actually pretty cool bottle 
 <michael> He said it is unisex
 <jacob> Wow I bet it was designed in Paris. In a room made of ice, Shaun Jean tested this very perfume on his Bengal tigers.
 <michael> But it smells like a man cologne to me 
 <michael> It's not bad smell
 <michael> Clean
 <michael> Dang 
 <michael> He's selling it for $55 
 <michael> He told WWD, “Everything I do is about whether I feel it, you know? Right now, this is the type of energy that I’m feeling and that I want men and women to experience. 3 a.m. is like, not a regular person’s time. It is for me, so I just want to share with people another level of freedom and truth that you have at 3 a.m. Anything can happen.”
 <michael> The Unisex fragrance, which will comes in a clear rectangular bottle, boasts notes of bergamot, mandarin, orange blossom cardamom, geranium and fig leaf. 
 <michael> I'm definitely feelin another layer of freedom and truth

 <taylor> Maneb
 <angel> Wow what a bootiful day out
 <peter> Larp at mission oaks park
 <vance> FUCK
 <vance> I WANNA LARP
 <vance> AND BRING MY WEAPONS
 <vance> AND MURDER EVERYONE
 <vance> that's just battling not larping huh
 <peter> Yep
 <vance> O
 <angel> Anyone down to hang rn?
 <angel> Hang?
 <vance> I can't tonight 
 <nina> Pretty sure Hunter wanted to hang tonight, someone should shoot him a text message
 <michael> he still has not rejoined GROUP Chet? :0
 <nina> No but that doesn't mean you can't text him normally... You can still include him even if you have to text him individually
 <michael> this is the future I shouldn't have to work that hard 
 <michael> I'm just gonna make a script that forwards him the messages from the group chat to private message 
 <michael> there's no escape 
 <vance> He knows he's always invited whenever we hang <3
 <vance> But I guess he still needs to be informed
 <vance> Aka this group message but that's ok I guess lol
 <nina> Well no its just that he's out of the group message now so he won't know when you are hanging
 <nina> Hence why I said you should shoot him a text
 <peter> Just finished up with house work today
 <vance> I mean ya I get that
 <peter> I'm down for hang whenever
 <vance> But like he can always join whenever he wants to lol
 <peter> Yeah you're right vance
 <peter> You can always fight me
 <taylor> (yeah) 
 <nina> But he can't join if he doesn't know about it, that's what I'm saying 
 <nina> I mean if sending him a text is too difficult or idk okie dokie I just know he wanted to hang too but nvm 
 <nina> Not trying to start anything 
 <taylor> I think its just confusing he left and hasn't rejoined bc hes been invited back multiple times
 <taylor> But ya hang I concur
 <nina> Yeah but you guys make it seem like since he left the group now you can't communicate with him
 <nina> He didn't leave cause he hates you or something
 <peter> I still text outside of chat
 <nina> And we can communicate outside of this chat
 <nina> Yeah same
 <peter> If talking to one person
 <taylor> (yeah) 
 <peter> Guys
 <peter> I will go insane if no hang
 <taylor> Smame
 <michael> I have a solution you guys 
 <michael> Let's all message hunter 
 <peter> No
 <michael> ur rite 
 <peter> I already did, I can't double message
 <peter> I have a code
 <peter> (code)
 <michael> I postulate that hunter has been abducted into a particular sect of psuedojudeologism 
 <michael> this sect promotes abstinence from multiple instances of communication occurring simultaneously and concurrently 
 <peter> Wow
 <peter> I'd agree with you, if that was so blatantly wrong
 <peter> Wasn't 
 <angel> I think Hunter's begun a life of crime fighting and is distancing himself from us so that we can't be used as leverage
 <michael> that's probably it 
 <michael> I have consulted with the thought police 
 <michael> And you all can come over to my house 
 <nina> HOLY SHIT YOU GUYS 
 <nina> this chat is not our friendship 
 <michael> We can't toke there tho 
 <nina> Our friendship is US
 <nina> jesus
 <michael> Nina I don't wanna invalidate that but I'm pretty sure we're all just takin a piss here and making jokes 
 <michael> I understand not wanting to be in a group chat, it can be cumbersome to have that constant flood of messages 
 <michael> I honestly don't care if I have to message him, in fact I've been messaging him for a while lol 
 <michael> Just wanna make that clear, poop dookie
 <michael> oh yah also we can watch a movie if you guys want to, with SURROUND SOUND 
 <peter> Poop dookie
 <michael> We should watch a spookie moovie
 <peter> I hate scary films
 <peter> But I'll do it
 <nina> Sorry, Vance and Tay sounded like they were having legit convos w/ me about it
 <peter> Messaging is a fantastic means of misinterpretation. 
 <nina> And Hunter mentioned earlier he wanted to have you guys over so I was trying to getcha to see that now you're gonna have to talk to him directly so that you could come over but I getcha and sorry 
 <peter> I don't think he's feeling too hot, idk. 
 <peter> I'm just gonna smoke this bowl right quick
 <nina> Yeah not tonight 
 <michael> No ur rifht I shouldn't speak for tay or Vance 
 <michael> Also I have consulted with the djinn himself 
 <michael> He is indeed feeling poopy
 <peter> Poop dookie 
 <michael> Lmk when y'all are coming
 <michael> I'm in the shower currently 
 <peter> I shall
 <peter> Let you know
 <michael> I would like to let it be known
 <michael> I have already thoroughly inundated myself with thc
 <michael> God bless 
 <michael> I am out of the shower 
 <michael> çømëth
 <peter> In 15
 <vance> O no I didn't mean for it to sound like we weren't going to communicate with him
 <vance> Like we obviously will 
 <peter> Tay
 <peter> Do you need ride
 <vance> I honestly didn't mean anything beside that we talk about all our plans in here too
 <nina> (afro)

 <michael> En route much nausea, once I reached the bathroom diarrhea and vomiting resumed 
 <peter> Here

 <michael> If Marg still didn't fire him I would laugh 
 <michael> She has lots of weird stickers huh Ian 
 <michael> She's spent a ludicrous amount of money on them 
 <ian> I feel uncomfortable with them

 <jacob> Are u saying gay can't be cute
 <jacob> What the heck Nina check yourself
 <jacob> Fucking oppressor
 <jacob> U and me lmao
 <michael> wow my videos start such a huge conversation on an important discussion. I should make videos professionally. Then maybe I can make waves in the real world as opposed to line chats. Wow you've all opened my eyes 
 <nina> I just meant it seemed he was using it in a negative connotation  
 <vance> Watch out for gay agenda
 <vance> Gonna turn eveey1 gaay
 <jacob> U will make waves in the gay community lol.  Where u belong
 <jacob> what using it the word gay are gays its now??? Are they not PEO ple???
 <vance> Tay has a gay butthole
 <vance> He has declared so many tines

 <vance> Like snacks are fine
 <vance> But if I sit down for a meal
 <vance> I gotta poop right after
 <jacob> Wtf are u sure u are digesting
 <vance> Its previous poop
 <vance> When u eat a lot there is reflex to poop what u haf
 <vance> To make room for new poop
 <jacob> Maybe ur body is maximum efficiency. Unload/load
 <vance> Yah I eat on the toilet
 <vance> And poop as I eat
 <peter> What goes in must come out
 <vance> My stool is perfect rn
 <vance> Not too hard
 <vance> Not to soft
 <vance> Easy to wipe
 <vance> Virtually undetectable after
 <taylor> My stools also lookin pretty good rn
 <vance> When I'm at ur house my stool is terrible
 <vance> I'm probably the cause of all ur septic problems 
 <taylor> I just took a big stool and it flushed no problem so hopefully ur stool can be as good as mine
 <vance> Mine is that good at my house 
 <vance> But at ur house we eat stool too much to have good stool
 <vance> I think I eat a significant amount of dairy products when I'm high
 <vance> I accidentally saved that 
 <vance> But I probably won't delete it 
 <jacob> I eat so much poop when I'm high I just can't help myself
 <jacob> Just boy things..

 <michael> And I'm the only one here 
 <michael> This is hilarious 
 <michael> I ate a huge piece of wasabi
 <michael> Got everyone to pitch in and now my $30 all you can eat meal is free 
 <michael> However my stomach feels much akin to the broiling pits of Beelzebub 
 <jacob> Have a good shit
 <peter> Woo heading home
 <peter> Yeah, I got no class tomorrow 
 <peter> I'll let you know when I'm in cam
 <ian> Man Pete working those 12 hour days

 <ian> I mean I have work at 7 but oh well 
 <ian> Mikes dead he's gone
 <jacob> Presentation 2moro please noo
 <jacob> Nate gimme ur presenting energies
 <ian> Pretend everyone's naked 
 <jacob> I ain't gonna HAVE NO PAPAH
 <jacob> I will try to imagine them all naked in scrutinous detail
 <jacob> But there r 2 many hottie's I don't want a stageboner
 <jacob> ; l
 <jacob> ; )
 <ian> But that'll distract them from the presentation 
 <jacob> Yes. They won't realize I am not speaking English.
 <jacob> Uuu m u n nummm s-s-s-s ugh *silent thinking* *boner*
 <jacob> As the blood exits my face I will have clarity of thought and whip out a sick presentation
 <ian> The boner is key
 <peter>  Here
 <peter> Come
 <ian> Coming 
 <peter> If anyone cane give a presentation 
 <peter> It's me
 <peter> And if it's not me it's you jaco
 <taylor> Its not u pete
 <vance> U know what they say
 <vance> If you do ur presentation naked its a lot easier
 <angel> No ur supposed to imagine that you're naked
 <taylor> I thought it was imagine ur teacher naked
 <angel> A common misquote, actually the teacher is supposed to imagine that the students are naked
 <vance> O I think my teachers are always nervous because it seems like they always do that
 <taylor> No the teacher is supposed to get the student naked
 <angel> Yea that makes sense. It is the instructors duty to transform the bare students into the learned
 <angel> Hence the ceremonial stripping of the students prior to presentation
 <angel> Did you died?
 <michael> I went through some severe gastrointestinal distress shortly after
 <peter> Same
 <michael> It's like I could feel this superheated blob sliding through my tubes 
 <michael> But for free all you can eat sushi 
 <michael> It was worth 
 <taylor> Imagine if ur forehead inflated as u inhaled and deflated as u exhaled
 <ian> Omg

 <peter> I think I know why Roxy sounded like she was going to rip out Nadelynn's throat the other night

 <jacob> Maybe NAD is a ghost
 <vance> But my ghost 
 <vance> Maybe my ghost is like casper
 <vance> But only mean ghost follow people
 <peter> Nat call
 <peter> Yeah
 <vance> Usually if you're not mean u should be able to pass on

 <michael> That doesn't have slant rhyme 
 <michael> Are you serious 
 <michael> I'm playing rhyme time with my brother and he threw that one at me 
 <michael> And I'm embarrassed I can't figure it out 
 <jacob> Are you serious
 <michael> Do you even know how to rhyme kid?
 <michael> Can you even spit bars?
 <jacob> slant rhymes aren't rhymes
 <jacob> smd
 <michael> You don't even know what a slant rhyme is I bet
 <jacob> do you have to know a combination before you challenge someone?
 <michael> Ya 
 <michael> He has one in mind already 
 <michael> A i have to figure it out
 <michael> The clue was "shiny weed"
 <jacob> I don't know any synonyms for the word weed 
 <jacob> unless its not specifically a weed and just referring to plants
 <michael> No the word isn't weed 
 <michael> That's te clue 
 <michael> So it could be ganja reefer 
 <michael> Herb bud 
 <michael> Etc
 <michael> That's why it's hard there is half a million names for weed 
 <michael> But he said several of the could work 
 <michael> Of them*
 <michael> HES TALKING ABOUT MARIJUANA 
 <taylor> do u have to come up with half rhyme for shiny too
 <taylor> Or can it just be any synonym of shiny
 <taylor> It's probably like happy tree
 <michael> The two words you come up with 
 <michael> Have to rhyme 
 <michael> YOURE NOT RHYMING 
 <taylor> Happy tree
 <taylor> Shiny weed
 <michael> here's an example: Clue: a citrus copycat answer: Mime Lime 
 <taylor> Oic
 <michael> clue: a cow loving pixie 
 <vance> Glazed blaze
 <taylor> Happy tree
 <michael> Answer: dairy fairy 
 <taylor> Is a half rhyme
 <taylor> Isn't that in his rulebook
 <michael> alright fuck your half rhyme 
 <taylor> Since were just making up rules as we go along
 <michael> I only want perfect rhymes 
 <taylor> Glee tree
 <michael> How is that shiny 
 <michael> Are you stupid or something 
 <michael> It's not happy tree 
 <taylor> Spree tree
 <taylor> Unleash hashish

 <ian> Okay I'll come now I'm at Brooke's 
 <ian> I am here
 <peter> Come 
 <michael> Holy fuck 
 <michael> My computer chair for my cubicle is $919 
 <michael> http://store.steelcase.com/seating/office-desk-chairs/leap
 <michael> I was like "damn this is really fucking cool, so much customizability and it's so comfy. I gotta get me one of these"
 <vance> Oh yah I think that's the same one my mom stolw
 <vance> Except diff cushion
 <vance> Mine is just the springy holey one
 <michael> https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nqQjNYx-Eyw
 <michael> this is premo desk chair 
 <michael> http://www.steelcase.com/products/office-chairs/leap/
 <michael> The adjustable keyboard/mouse pull out thing is also dope 
 <vance> Steal it
 <michael> I wish 
 <michael> I don't think I could get it through the turnstile 
 <vance> Yah my mom stole the chair by accident 
 <vance> But kept it on purpise
 <vance> She was moving offices
 <vance> Bc the whole building was moving or something
 <vance> So my mom put her chair in her car to take over
 <vance> But accidentally took home
 <michael> The way this base is set up, there's a main gate that you get your ID lookup and in that area there is parking and the security building, then there's a whole other fence and inside is the actual complex. That's where you scan your CAC card and this metal turnstile unlocks and let's one person in 
 <michael> Like my mentor says "You can't get inside without the CAC" 
 <michael> Lmao 
 <vance> Super secure subway 
 <michael> It's not that sorta turnstile 
 <michael> It's like 
 <michael> Those glass ones 
 <michael> In some banks 
 <michael> But instead of glass
 <michael> It's huge metal bars 
 <vance> O I think I know
 <vance> What ur talking aboot
 <vance> How is the work
 <michael> Image from http://www.turnstile-gate.com/photo/pl406476-rustproof_intelligent_automatic_stainless_steel_full_height_turnstile_gates_50_60_hz.jpg.
 <michael> Except there's even more metal bars than in that one so you can't even fit your arm through 
 <michael> Well I haven't got my CAC card yet so I can't access the computers, so so far he's been explaining contextual information about the work and we've ran through some use cases and drawn out some preliminary designs for the GUI of the database we're designing 
 <vance> I can't see it
 <vance> O that sounds very techy
 <vance> O ya thats what I was imagining 
 <michael> My lunch break is almost over but well Skype later and I'll go more in depth of what's I've been up to the past 2 days 
 <vance> Kkkkk
 <vance> Eat nutrition 
 <vance> Poo well
 <vance> Live long
 <ian> You have to go all the way up to SLO?

 <ian> Man I was on a different level last night 
 <peter> But I'm not on your side of cam nate
 <ian> Like I was completely aware of everything but non of it mattered 
 <ian> None 
 <michael> you achieved complete apathy 
 <michael> a coveted state 
 <ian> Practically 
 <peter> I'm here tay
 <vance> You were slumped in your chair and slightly bobbing your head to the beat of the music hahaha
 <ian> It was great dude 
 <ian> Bong rip, gravity bong, and then dab back to back was a personal record for me
 <vance> You should use mikes or Jakes head phones next time
 <vance> Music with their megaheadphones is crazy while high
 <ian> Definitely will 
 <jacob> You guys hear the new chance?
 <vance> No how'd you like it?
 <vance> Listening rn

 <michael> I've been working on my turtle stance 
 <michael> Wanna see 
 <vance> Ya
 <vance> U gotta work on your right trap 
 <vance> Ur shell is weak young one
 <michael> It's the angle 
 <vance> But really why are your traps so big
 <vance> Are they just like that
 <vance> Or are you Arnold Schwarzenegger
 <michael> The secret 
 <michael> Is that I've been going to the gym this whole time 
 <michael> Just only doing trap isolation exercises 
 <michael> jk, it's likely a mix of genetics and dipping 
 <vance> Dipping is bad for your teeth and gums
 <michael> TALKIN SMOOTHIES 
 <michael> not wacky tobacci
 <vance> U dip smoothies
 <vance> That's too cold for my teethies 
 <michael> Yah man 
 <michael> Delicious 
 <vance> Ur smoothie days are over
 <vance> Never look back
 <ian> Michael has passed the will of fire to me
 <michael> I never will 
 <michael> It's true 
 <michael> The wind that once filled my sails will live on inside Ian 
 <ian> I have gained strength through his wisdom 
 <vance> Why is the leaf village also fire
 <ian> The fire within your heart Vance 
 <vance> Also how did the fire nation, a tiny archipelago, have the man power and resources to take on the rest of the world for 100 years
 <michael> This is the latest I've been up this whole week 
 <michael> I've been sleeping at like 9 
 <vance> What time do you wake up
 <michael> 7
 <vance> Eeeee
 <vance> 7 is too early
 <michael> Luckily the guy I'm working with is not a morning person 
 <michael> It could be worse 
 <michael> It could be 6 
 <vance> Or 5
 <vance> Then commute to LA
 <michael> Ya
 <vance> I feel so bad for commuters
 <vance> I hope I don't have to
 <michael> I'm supposed to be in to work by 9 
 <michael> Which really isn't that bad 
 <vance> O ya
 <vance> U just wake up early enough for normal people routine 
 <vance> I would wake up at 8 
 <michael> And because I'm only 10-15 minutes away 
 <vance> Bc I can't wake up
 <vance> And I skip meals 
 <vance> That's very convenient
 <michael> Today I was a couple minutes late 
 <vance> God damn it
 <vance> Ur fired
 <vance> Done
 <vance> Never work in this town again 
 <michael> Because I didn't wake up at 7
 <michael> I got up at  lol 
 <vance> Lol
 <vance> Are you going to the gym now?
 <michael> So I showered real quick, got dressed, then ate some roast beef and shoveled Greek yoghurt in my mouth 
 <michael> I haven't started yet 
 <michael> Honestly I've been fucking exhausted the past bunch of days 
 <michael> Like I'll just get home, eat dinner, lay in bed and text for an hour, then sleep 
 <vance> Are you working 8hrs?
 <michael> 9-530 
 <vance> Ooo
 <vance> U should just start a family
 <michael> And my mentor is super knowledgeable and a super fast talker and he's also a worker bee
 <michael> So I usually come home and my brain is just 
 <michael> kaput 
 <michael> We should skype tomorrow 
 <michael> I'll tell you more 
 <michael> What I've been learning and doing and stuff 
 <vance> Yeah I should get off work about the same time 
 <michael> And details 
 <michael> But I'm really enjoying it 
 <peter> I'll be up in SLO, so idk when work will be done,  but I'll try
 <vance> When you get settled nicely we'll set up a trip to visit you some weekend
 <michael> I feel like my brain is at max concentration the whole day
 <michael> And I also think his work ethic is gonna rub off on me 
 <vance> Don't get back on the espresso shot train
 <michael> Like today, I stayed til 6 just because I wanted to finish this thing we were working on 
 <michael> there's free coffee 
 <michael> So what I've been doing is just fill up a big thermos 
 <vance> I'm limiting you to 3 cups a day
 <vance> O
 <michael> And then drink it constantly 
 <vance> 2 big thermoses 
 <vance> Well
 <vance> Idk I guess its still better than espresso shots 
 <vance> Don't get addicted again lol
 <michael> Honestly my coffee consumption has skyrocketed, it's just a lot more spread out now 
 <vance> Make sure you rinse your mouth
 <vance> Don't want to stain ur teethies
 <michael> So instead of espresso shots or downing a whole cup 
 <vance> My mommy always yells that at me
 <michael> It's just 
 <michael> Wake up @ 7
 <michael> And then consistently drink coffee 
 <michael> Throughout the whole day 
 <michael> I have a huge thermos of water and a huge thermos of coffee
 <michael> Dude 
 <michael> Yesterday 
 <michael> I got off my lunch break 
 <michael> At like 1230 
 <michael> And then my guy and I went to this conference room with a whiteboard and huge screen 
 <michael> And we didn't leave that conference room Til 530 
 <michael> Skipped both my 10 minute breaks

 <vance> And soda
 <michael> ur gonna need that 
 <vance> Nope
 <vance> That's what I'll need
 <michael> How often do you clean ur pax 
 <vance> I usually do it once every month-month and a half
 <vance> But this time it was like a semester 
 <michael> my ARIZER is dangerous after I clean it 
 <vance> Lol
 <vance> I get so high now
 <michael> airflow is TOO good 
 <vance> O can't drive and vape too much now

 <vance> Lol the spare keys are in the place that you lock up
 <michael> Check out this sweet ass laptop case I get
 <vance> Do you get to keep it
 <michael> I hope so 
 <vance> And they did provide the laptop on your desk?
 <michael> Ya 
 <michael> The laptops drive is fully encrypted too 
 <vance> Yah
 <vance> They probably won't let you keep
 <vance> Bc material on it
 <michael> I'm stealing both 
 <vance> They'll smash the laptop with a hammer right before your eyes
 <michael> lol there's no way I'm keeping any of it 
 <michael> But I can dream
 <michael> These are taxpayer dollarsVance 
 <vance> Man the govt spends so much money though
 <vance> Just steal a shit ton of office supplies to compensate
 <vance> My mom takes really nice mechanical pencils for me
 <vance> They're like $8 a pack at staples
 <michael> these ones?
 <vance> If you pretend 100% of your tax dollars is dedicated to coronas office supplies
 <vance> Yah
 <vance> They fit my hand perfectly 
 <vance> Feels so nice
 <michael> Yah they are nice 
 <michael> the pens are nice too
 <michael> The ink flows so perfectly 
 <vance> Pretty much all the office supplies at my house are from the base
 <vance> Ya those are skillcraft too
 <vance> I have those too
 <michael> I'll probably end up taking some pens 
 <michael> What does chicken that's gone bad taste like 
 <michael> asking for a friend 
 <vance> Idk how long have you had that chicken
 <vance> Bout 8-9 days?
 <vance> If it doesn't taste like it did before
 <vance> Then its probably not good
 <vance> If you got that straight from the deli I don't think they really use preservatives 
 <vance> Although its already cooked idk
 <vance> I'm just spewing shot out of my ass
 <michael> it hasn't been out 
 <michael> But yeah I've had it for about a 8 days I think 
 <michael> Idk it's kinda slimy and tastes a bit sour but idk if I'm placebo 
 <michael> Ya 
 <michael> It's from Ralph deli 
 <michael> I threw it out 
 <michael> FUK DAT
 <michael> I already ate like half a pound tho 
 <michael> guess my bowel movement will tell me if I made a mistake 
 <michael> oops

 <jacob> Have to wait until after the 14th or something
 <vance> O I see

 <jacob> I mean, I assume not. Hence "renewing"

 <jacob> I wouldn't be getting my full $15 worth for the year

 <vance> 8=D
 <peter> Travel to SD
 <ian> So I'm at Charter Oak with Jeremiah enjoying a beer when the cops showed up and gave us a "don't drink in public" speech and left 
 <ian> Good guy
 <vance> Man
 <vance> Charter oak used yo be a safe haven for our illegal habits
 <ian> The man is shackling us down 
 <vance> Fuck the system 
 <michael> So my mentor reserved this huge conference room for us 
 <michael> I got to set up camp 
 <michael> Walk in and there's a room full of people looking at me like I have 4 heads 
 <michael> They start closing their laptops, alt-tabbing 
 <michael> I'm just like "uh.. SORRY" and high tail it 
 <michael> Apparantly it was command lmao they didn't reserve the conference room 
 <ian> Oh no hahaha
 <michael> bastards 
 <michael> that conference room was reserved for ME
 <ian> They took it from you Mike 
 <ian> You have to do something about it 
 <michael> yah they think just because they are in charge and make all the decisions 
 <michael> They can just waltz in and take any conference room they choose 
 <michael> No there's a PROCESS
 <michael> You have to SCHEDULE a RESERVATION like I DID 
 <ian> Take a stand 
 <ian> Utilize the system and make it pure 
 <michael> I'm gonna walk in and piss on the lot of them 
 <michael> let it be known I WILL NOT BE WALKED ON 
 <ian> I was thinking a more precessional route but I like that more 
 <ian> Professional* but also if you guys haven't seen
 <ian> http://youtu.be/GE2BkLqMef4
 <angel> The nerve of some people these days, mowing their lawn at noon, like come on people are trying to sleep
 <angel> Also mike reseize that conference room
 <angel> Look them in the eye
 <angel> And tell them that you are the captain now
 <vance> Its too late wangel
 <vance> They know mike is a spy
 <vance> They're just pretending they know nothing to collect more evidence against him
 <angel> All is lost then
 <angel> There can be no asylum once they discover ur dark secrets mike
 <vance> You have to try to escape now
 <vance> They will still stop you
 <vance> But this will prevent them from building more evidence 
 <michael> shit
 <michael> now's my chance 
 <michael> The entire branch left to celebrate the going away of one of our members 
 <michael> I stayed behind 
 <michael> I'm all alone in this building 
 <michael> I'll gather up all the laptops and make a run for it 
 <vance> Run for it 
 <vance> Oiii
 <vance> Abv on empty stomach hits fast
 <ian> How much did you have?
 <vance> The top of a Reece's cup
 <ian> That sounds yummy
 <vance> Yah u can't taste the abv with a Reece's cup

 <ian> But that's cool, what a nice guy 
 <peter> Good guy land lord
 <taylor> The leather chair seems nice until it harnesses smell of 100 butts
 <taylor> Also shirtless computer gaming is rough
 <vance> Or in ur boxers
 <vance> Ur legs will stick too
 <michael> hey 
 <peter> Hey
 <michael> this is for shirtless programming and database work 
 <michael> not trivial drivel like VIDEOGAMING 
 <michael> also I don't care if it smells like butts
 <michael> I'm gone in 8 weeks and this chair is staying here 
 <peter> Woo
 <vance> Mike I can't see ur prof pic
 <michael> probably because there is no profile picture 
 <michael> I have decided to walk the noble eightfold path 
 <michael> and have disregarded all material things 
 <peter> Oh shit hit the fan.
 <michael> most notably, profile pictures 
 <vance> R u a monk
 <vance> That's probably exactly what you'd look like if you were a monk
 <taylor> Would u rather have a perpetually smelly butt or pubes as ur head hair
 <vance> Can you smell the butt through jeans
 <taylor> Thru anything
 <vance> If my pubes are sparse would that reflect on my head
 <taylor> Well what do u mean
 <vance> Like if I don't have a lot of pubes
 <vance> Will I not have a lot of hair
 <taylor> Oo
 <taylor> Uh no regular vance hair
 <taylor> But pubes
 <vance> O
 <vance> Could I shave it all off
 <taylor> No
 <taylor> It regrows very quickly
 <vance> O I still pick pube head
 <taylor> Ok i guess
 <vance> Wbu
 <taylor> You coulda asked more questions 
 <taylor> I cant answer
 <vance> Y is there a smelly loop hole
 <taylor> I must remain impartial
 <vance> Or am I stuck in the hairy situation 
 <taylor> U answered 
 <vance> Ya I'll just wear a hat for the rest of my life 
 <taylor> Sweaty pube hat hair 
 <taylor> Imagine
 <taylor> If u will
 <vance> U didn't say I had to be sweaty 
 <taylor> They eould just become sweaty
 <taylor> From wearing a hat a lot
 <vance> Only on hot days
 <taylor> If u ate hot cheetos
 <michael> So APPARANTLY the r2d2 gun can shoot 4500 rounds a minute 
 <michael> And has a 2.2 mile effective range

 <michael> you connection is squelched before you even know it 
 <michael> your*
 <jacob> See, that's the beauty of it... *slight smile, eyes track across the audience during a silent pause. the listeners aren't even aware their eyes are getting larger, glimmering with fascination*
 <jacob> C-can you come over and... Show me how to... code... Senpai?
 <ian> I'm considering asking Margaret to not work with Sam 
 <michael> You wouldn't be the first 
 <michael> That's the reason she got a big talking to the first time, because I spoke up to Margaret about it 
 <michael> And then when Sam asked her why this was being brought up 
 <michael> Marg was like "some people have said they don't want to work with you" (me)
 <michael> And then Sam assumed it was Josie 
 <ian> It's becoming a burden and really killing my mood when I work
 <ian> That's hilarious though
 <ian> She just let me off early because "I seem like I don't want to be there"
 <michael> yah she still thinks it was him to this day 
 <ian> No shit you've been here for 40 minutes out of my 6 hours and I already want to throw my head into a wall 
 <michael> Yeah definitely bring it up with Marg dude, altho honestly Sam has gotten so much shit from Marg and the owners already it might just drive her to quit early 
 <michael> She reformed for a while, or at least she started liking me a lot more and being super nice to me, but I assume because she's on her way out she doesn't give a shit anymore 
 <ian> If she's leaving soon anyway I don't really care. If anything I was just being very empathetic towards what she was saying because she's so damn passive about everything 
 <taylor> Hey whats up

 <peter> You looked at the price tag that was still on it.

 <peter> I knew it
 <michael> either I have looked at this webpage before and subconsciously withdrew this information from some derelict space within the confines of my brain

 <jacob> I'm down
 <michael> We gotta get the pen too 
 <michael> https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=89&v=p4XpwLHPlhw
 <michael> I recommend watching that entire video 
 <vance> Mike did you go to the dispensery
 <vance> What was that weed snapchat
 <michael> I took some bud and my arizer with me this time 
 <vance> Oooooo
 <michael> Funny thing is I actually didn't even use it 
 <michael> Except for the car ride to corona 
 <vance> I always imagined you'd break the same way I would
 <vance> I probably would have just gone to the dispensery
 <vance> After a couple of days lol
 <michael> hahaha
 <vance> Don't you have work in like 5 hours
 <michael> I expected to vape a bit as i decompressed after a lot day of work 
 <michael>  But I never had the craving 
 <michael> So I essentially brought my things for no reason lol 
 <michael> But I suppose it'll make the car ride home this weekend a bit sweeter 
 <vance> For the car ride back
 <vance> Damn it
 <vance> You beat me to it
 <vance> Are you coming back tomorrow?
 <michael> and yes, now that I have my CAC, and now that my account details and what not are processed for the computers (that happened today), I will indeed be going into work tmrw 
 <michael> I have a meeting at 9 with the other interns and our POC to discuss stuff, then I have a meeting with my boss to do a project review, then we'll probably work together on it for the rest of the day 
 <vance> New Mike lived for almost 2 weeks
 <vance> But new Mike realized
 <michael> yah I was originally gonna stay here this weekend but it's hot as shit and the AC unit failed today and the people aren't coming into 
 <vance> Sleep does not matter
 <michael> fix it Til Monday 
 <vance> Yah I told u corona was hot as poop
 <michael> Well, it was mostly the fact that I was able to work from home 
 <vance> Oh ya I guess
 <michael> I actually was able to adjust to the 9-5 quite easily, I found myself falling asleep at like 8 or 9 naturally 
 <vance> But new Mike was not supposed to falter 
 <vance> New miiiiike
 <michael> my natural circadian rhythms do not adhere to your social norms 
 <vance> Ur circadian rhythms are anything but natural hahahahahaha
 <michael> ive lived this way my whole life u poop 
 <michael> this is NATURAL 
 <michael> I AM ORGANIC HUMAN LIFE 
 <vance> R u really though 
 <michael> idk 
 <michael> I've taken a liking to hologram theory recently 
 <vance> It's OK goku and all them were friends with Android 13
 <vance> Crilin even married her
 <vance> Was it Android 13?
 <vance> That all of existence is a hologram
 <vance> Or the more recent black holes are just holograms
 <michael> idek never watched dbz
 <michael> Yah all of existence is hologram 
 <vance> If it was proven that all of existence was a hologram
 <vance> Would that change your perception of reality
 <michael> no 
 <vance> Like would life mean less
 <vance> Ya me neither
 <michael> if it was proven that all of existence was a computer simulation 
 <michael> I would hook myself up to an IV of DMT and float in a sensory deprivation tank until my life was taken of natural causes 
 <vance> Mike u fool
 <vance> You could use your four year under grad computer science degree
 <vance> To hack all of existence as we know
 <michael> so that I could better communicate to the transdimensional ether beings 
 <vance> And give us super powers
 <vance> O
 <michael> the ones that made the simulation 
 <michael> the machine elves 
 <vance> I mean I guess thatd be cool too
 <vance> What if they were just what we imagine to be the future
 <vance> And they created a computer simulation to recreate the entire history of the univers
 <vance> So they were pretty much just seeing into the past
 <vance> Like I could be one of those guys great great great great great grandpappy
 <michael> Well I'm a firm believer in a radial model of spacetime 
 <michael> So with that being said, I am a machine elf 
 <vance> I don't understand what the radial model is
 <vance> Like a cycle
 <vance> Or that it emits
 <michael> like a Möbius strip 
 <vance> O I see
 <vance> So it is like a cycle?
 <vance> That's a circle with a twist right 
 <michael> alright I'm going to sleep 
 <michael> perhaps I will dream of electric sheep tonight 
 <michael> farewell 
 <vance> Ya me too
 <vance> I dreamed there was a dead spider in my abv
 <vance> Goodnight
 <michael> It was astral projection 
 <michael> You've already consumed it 
 <vance> O god
 <michael> a thousand you's have consumed a thousand spiders 
 <vance> I didn't count it in my macros
 <michael> forever anticipating 
 <michael> deliverance 
 <michael> a
 <michael> W
 <michael> A
 <michael> I
 <michael> T
 <michael> S

 <vance> I had a pretty bad migraine for a few days though 
 <ian> I think it was just a random occurrence 
 <ian> But also I have been working a lot lately and people come in sick all the time to get drinks 
 <ian> Handling money is a dangerous thing 
 <vance> Lol I was at work yesterday day for seven hours knowing perfectly well I was sick
 <vance> Rip all my customers 
 <ian> Oh no
 <vance> I washed my hands like every 20 mins though
 <vance> But I'd still rip everyone
 <ian> Margaret tried to have me come in today so I can do condenser cleaning and I laughed

 <michael> I looked up the default pass to login to this model of router and sure enough 
 <michael> The user is admin and the password is password 
 <michael> So I've taken it upon myself to update the firmware and mess around with some of the settings 
 <ian> Hahahaha
 <ian> You don't think they'll get upset?

 <michael> The whole router is using default setup 
 <michael> The guy who's renting this place out is working constantly 
 <michael> No ones gonna know anythin

 <ian> I would 
 <ian> But
 <ian> I'm stuck 
 <angel> anyone want to grab breakfast tomm?
 <peter> I have school in the morn
 <peter> Staying up late isn't a prob but waking up is
 <angel> waking up late?
 <peter> Just waking up
 <angel> i understand
 <angel> when do you have class?
 <peter> 10
 <vance> I gotta work tomorrow 
 <peter> I'll wake up around like 920
 <angel> i see another time then
 <peter> My house is open for hang 
 <vance> Can you not hand later in the day angel?
 <angel> not on a regular basis
 <vance> Well tomorrow specifically 
 <angel> oh yea later in the day is fine
 <angel> but i was feelling like grabbing breakfast tom
 <vance> Aw my son are you trying to dine ate the fine establishment of Pete breakfast house
 <angel> no though that'd be cool
 <angel> just prefer to hang early
 <vance> I can prob early hang thurs
 <vance> Although that would suggest wed is not a late hang
 <michael> ow AHE woah 
 <michael> Ow how wa u 
 <michael> that's the original without the line vignette but it's super zoomed in 
 <michael> Holy fucking shit 
 <michael> New google translate feature 
 gy 
 :26	<michael> top notch 
 <michael> Holy shit 
 <michael> I simmered all my honey oil from my ARIZER straw out in milk last night and drank it to help me fall asleep 
 <michael> I just woke up hilariously stoned 
 <ian> I could only imagine 
 <vance> How did it taste
 <peter> Yo
 <ian> Yot
 <peter> Hang
 <ian> Around 3
 <peter> I'm going shopping for moms bday
 <peter> Be back whenever
 <ian> Kk
 <michael> It tasted fine, but the small pieces of weed that made it through were a bit gross to drink 
 <michael> Hot milk yummy tho, good for sleep
 <michael> Amazing body high
 <michael> When I woke up everything was very distorted and fuzzy 
 <michael> Was gr8
 <vance> Hmmm
 <vance> Use a strainer next time
 <vance> Too bad I'm lactose intolerant lol
 <michael> good idea 
 <peter> Ily
 <michael> u could use coconut milk 
 <ian> Or soy or almond 
 <michael> Just drink cooking oil Vance 
 <ian> That's probably your best bet 
 <vance> Bacon grease
 <vance> Lard
 <vance> Does your ac work again mike
 <peter> Are we hang?
 <michael> Ya 
 <michael> It fixed on thurs 
 <michael> Or at least I noticed it 
 <michael> The system was fine but the air filter was bad 
 <michael> I need to invest in a strainer 
 <michael> I was high for the whole day 
 <peter> Right there with ya buddy.
 <jacob> How'd you extract the oil exactly?
 <jacob> Alcohol?
 <jacob> Be as vague as possible
 <jacob> Brb, gonna put my arizer in a glass of milk
 <ian> Lol
 <michael> I literally just simmered some milk on the stove and put my straw in the pot 
 <michael> Made sure to stir it a lot so it didn't burn da milk 
 <michael> It just came out from the heat 
 <michael> Would recommend a strainer, especially for your stem lol 
 <michael> I just downed the cup in one go so it wasn't so bad but if you wanted to make it tasty, strain it and add honey or chocolate powder 
 <michael> there's probably some better recipes on /r/vaporents or w.e
 <michael> or /r/arizer
 <michael> I'd imagine whole milk or cream would be better so there's more to bind to 
 <michael> But I just used 2% 
 <ian> It kind of bothers me that people can farm in hearthstone 
 <ian> Or pay to win
 <ian> In a sense at least
 <jacob> Ty mike

 <michael> My hand was too full almost entire game 
 <michael> Kept playing this Murlock card that gave both of us 2 cards on battle cry, Sap to keep replaying it, gang up to shuffle even more into his deck, and vanish to make all minions go back 
 <michael> There was this great exchange where he placed down lore walker cho, played sap on one of my minions, then I played sap on lorewalker cho and we kept sapping for multiple turns 
 <michael> Each turn playing the same two cards, lorewalker cho and mad bomber 
 <vance> Wow its like ur right here with us

 <ian> Is that what you were getting all of last night 
 <michael> no that was foe reaper
 <michael> grim patron is kind of a weird niche card that's kind of shitty imo 
 <michael> 5 cost 3/3
 <michael> If it survives damage though, it summons another grim patron 
 <michael> So I had 4 grim patrons all with the capability of summoning more grim patrons 
 <michael> I had never got that card to work because by the time you play it they can just 1 shot it usually 
 <michael> But this guy was dumb and played mad bomber 
 <ian> Jesus Christ
 <vance> Yoooo I got off early where are you guys?
 <peter> We are at haggens
 <peter> Going to ian's then gas then beach
 <michael> Meet us @ Ian's

 <ian> No Pete's getting you 
 <vance> No we are on a short detour
 <vance> Maybe 15-20
 <taylor> Where
 <vance> The mission is commencing 
 <vance> Mission accomplished heading home
 <taylor> Yahere
 <ian> Come through wife 
 <ian> Side 
 <vance> Omg 
 <vance> Police followed me all the way home
 <vance> It was so scary 
 <michael> dang 
 <vance> Yah it was nuts
 <vance> I decided to take the route that goes all the way thought the neighborhoods
 <vance> Up to crestview
 <vance> I saw one police by mission
 <vance> Then as I was driving past locker park
 <vance> There was another police there just waiting in the road and it shined its light through my windshield but I just kept driving
 <vance> Then when I finally had to get onto las posas and leave the neighborhood
 <vance> As soon as I turn onto las posas
 <vance> Another police car come right behind me
 <vance> And he literally tailgated me all the way until the very last turn into my neighborhood
 <vance> They followed be up the hill and everything 
 <vance> I bet they followed me bc I took a route to avoid police lol
 <ian> Wow
 <vance> Yeah man I was actually followed home
 <vance> My heart was pounding so hard
 <vance> I was so high and I looked in the mirror and my eyes were bloodshot
 <ian> I couldn't handle that 
 <vance> Yeah that was probably my most terrifying high experience lol
 <ian> I'm just extremely groggy 
 <vance> Yeah you drank a lot of that black drank
 <vance> Oh shit my shift just got canceled oooyaaa
 <ian> I did a moon rock and took a dab too
 <ian> It was pretty great 
 <ian> But (sweet)
 <vance> Damn if I knew my shift would get canceled I could have stayed
 <ian> We hanged until 4
 <vance> Aw jeez
 <vance> Good thing we had so much food
 <vance> Party fuel
 <ian> We didn't even finish the tri-tip

 <peter> I think i forgot my charger
 <ian> I'll look after this terrible poop

 <vance> We can save the smore stuff for next time
 <vance> I kinda wanna just stock up on Weiner's while they're still on sale for 4th of july
 <vance> Then we can just bbq whenever 
 <ian> Not a bad idea 
 <vance> I bet we could mass produce smores on the grill
 <vance> After were done cooking and the charcoal is dying out
 <vance> It'll be just warm enough to melt mallows
 <vance> I also like how the life gaurds don't care about anything besides people drowning
 <vance> Like the people were setting off fireworks
 <vance> And they didn't even do anything 
 <ian> Yes. We can do this so much more often 
 <vance> We should try at least once every other week
 <vance> Ian do you have any kind of piece
 <ian> I don't 
 <ian> But I want to get one 
 <vance> You should invest in at least an mflb
 <vance> Vapes are super convenient

 <vance> Yah they're called soup dumplings

 <jacob> Livin the dream
 <ian> Swav 
 <jacob> NASA's JPL open house is on Oct 10-11, which is next weekend. Me and Nate are likely going, for extra credit and also because its the mufukin JPL. If we go on Sunday my mom will probably drive us cuz she wants to go. We'd have to ideally be there at 10 AM because depending on how many people try to come, they usually stop letting people in by 11. Free admission.
 <jacob> If ya don't know the JPL= jet propulsion labs, rockets and shit. Basically we can see how underfunded NASA is and then write a letter to our congressman about ending the war on drugs. But it'll probably be rad.
 <peter> In down
 <jacob> Also its on the edge of Pasadena so its like an hour drive or more so we'd leave by 9 AM on a Sat/Sunday. Also we could totally hit up the Roma deli in Pasadena and get fuckin delicious meats and cheeses and bread its dank assfuck
 <jacob> Me mum has 5 seat car btw
 <jacob> But we're all licensed drivers lok
 <michael> Oh I was gonna go with the computer science club at Moorpark because they have a bus 
 <michael> so instead of being in your overcrowded mom car
 <michael> "I will Be in a bus full of stinky neck beard basement dweller a"
 <michael> get fukd son 
 <michael> You guys should just RSVP with them and pretend to be comp Sci majors 
 <jacob> I don't need to pretend I'm a huge fukking dork to appreciate NASA
 <jacob> I got air conditioning in a smooth luxury ride u can fuckoff
 <jacob> U are one of the neckbearsss
 <jacob> Actually I have a neckbeard rn
 <jacob> It's gross and itchy

 <jacob> They do this every class
 <vance> I def sleep through entire classes though
 <jacob> Attendance isn't required in this class

 <jacob> But I use it maybe five minutes out of the 75
 <vance> And people watch the other 70
 <jacob> No my point was these people specifically never pay attention
 <jacob> And they distract me with their noise and shit while I'm trying to lay attention
 <jacob> I don't give a fuck about the  30 other people using their phones silently and subtley
 <jacob> But since its about u now, u didn't pay $300 to sleep in a wooden chair and u know it

 <michael> Fuck Bank of America 
 <ian> Olas was a good choice 
 <michael> They'll rue the fucking day they rejected Michael Fischler's application for an upgraded credit card despite a year of on time full monthly payments 
 <michael> BANK OF AMERICA IS LOSING MY BUSINESS 
 <michael> discover approved my credit card with a 1000 limit meanwhile fucking bank of shit over here barely upgraded me to 700 a couple months ago 
 <michael> I'm talking a perfect track record and beautiful credit score and they're like "yah I guess u can handle the responsibility of 200 more dollars 
 <michael> And then discover is like "yah take 1000 a month man ur the man man" 
 <michael> and every time I go in to talk to these shitlords they are always trying to sell me some shit 
 <michael> Hey Michael I see you don't have a savings account with us? Do you have a savings account? Do you know the benefits? Open more accounts with us! 
 <michael> FUCK YOU of course I have a savings account but it's not with sewer fucking scum banks like you 
 <michael> Are you sure-
 <michael> YEAH IM GREAT WHERE I AM THANKS THO 
 <michael> every fucking time 
 <michael> /rant 
 <ian> If you said this to their face then maybe something would change 
 <michael> Usually I just say the last part 
 <michael> "I'm fine with what I have thanks." 
 <michael> And they always give me this smirk 
 <ian> That's obviously not good enough 
 <michael> I'm too polite for those ducks 
 <ian> Gain that confidence 
 <michael> nah there are plenty of other places I can take my business 
 <michael> Not worth the time arguing with those disgusting sycophants 
 <michael> Always trying to lube me up to open more accounts 
 <ian> That's the point. Make them realize how valuable you are and tell them to fuck themselves or give you more money 
 <michael> I'm nothing to them 
 <michael> My credit history is literally a year old 
 <michael> Besides, why waste my time with them. It's clear they're shit to me. I'm gonna close my checking with them 
 <ian> Do what you need to do boy
 <michael> This snap is gold Ian

 <vance> Did you take it home
 <peter> He did it
 <vance> Theyre gon getchu for treason 
 <michael> I haven't taken it home yet
 <michael> I just took it down 3 flights of stairs and out a side exit and put it in the back seat of my car
 <vance> You're turning into my mom
 <michael> I did what needed to be done 
 <michael> My current desk chair is killing me 
 <michael> Besides this was like an extra I think idk it had a paper taped to it with my room number but every desk has a chair 
 <peter> You'll never make it out the gate
 <vance> Michael Fischler is the new Edward snowden
 <michael> It's been sitting here for 2 weeks and no one has taken it so 
 <michael> It's safe to say everyone has forgot it exists 
 <peter> It's vital to the US
 <vance> It's the pillar of support that holds together the American dream
 <michael> shit 
 <peter> The American dream is (dead) 
 <michael> This isn't one of those 1000 ones tho 
 <michael> It's some other type looks similiar to the one I was gonna get 
 <michael> Still probably worth like 500 lol 
 <vance> At least $200 for sure
 <vance> We should start a business of selling stolen chairs
 <michael> You think that's gonna pan out 
 <vance> I think we can make it work
 <ian> We'll have to see
 <vance> At bare minimum it'll cover our drug addictions
 <michael> My alibi 
 <michael> Is that is has a paper that said "free" on it 
 <michael> I saw a cabinet like that in the hall 
 <michael> So I think that's a reasonable excuse 
 <michael> If cameras saw me it wouldn't look weird but if office managers saw me when I rolled by it would be wierd 
 <peter> Incoming
 <peter> (helicopter) 
 <michael> Btw peter I'll bring your backpack to anthro 
 <peter> I've needed it all day.
 <ian> When's your midterm Pete?

 <ian> It'll be a close race 
 <michael> Ian dies first 
 <ian> When
 <michael> Idk 
 <michael> It'll be emphysema though 
 <michael> We should place bets 
 <michael> On how everyone in our friend group dies 
 <ian> And when 
 <ian> When is important 
 <ian> Because we're all going to die young 
 <michael> That's harder but yeah bigger payout 
 <michael> I will live forever 
 <michael> In the cloud
 <michael> Oh shit I gotta drive to you nate 
 <michael> OMW 
 <ian> Lol fair enough 
 <angel> As long as I'm alive I'll never die, so good luck mortals

 <ian> Ty
 <michael> maybe ian doesnt want to submit to the glorious google overlords
 <michael> maybe ian values some things like privacy over conveniance
 <ian> Oh no I have drive 
 <michael> MAYBE HE DOESNT WANT TO CONFORM
 <michael> TO YOUR SYSTEM
 <ian> Just not the album 
 <michael> (￣ー￣)

 <michael> when was that one
 <vance> 9/12/14
 <michael> alright
 <michael> im not gonna have
 <michael> faces of myself
 <michael> that should be clear
 <michael> that would look weird i just want faces of you guys
 <ian> Lel the text 
 <vance> What are these faces for
 <michael> for my lock screen
 <michael> I will straw poll top 10 
 <michael> And they will fill this 
 <vance> U can have your own face for your lock screen
 <michael> Fill these numbers 
 <vance> Hahahahhahaha you can do that?
 <vance> That's pretty cool
 <michael> Yah I got some neat new jailbreak tweaks 
 <michael> This is actually a combination of two different hacks 
 <vance> I think a photo of you should be #5 though
 <vance> Is there 10 of us exactly?
 <vance> Us 8 and hunt and ninz
 <michael> nah i was hoping i could get some with two faces
 <michael> id prefer not to leave anyone out but if there arent any contenders for pics
 <vance> Oooo isee isee

 <vance> The one and only
 <vance> Beside this one and only
 <vance> Ok I'm out

 <ian> ian.jones987654321@gmail.com

 <michael> if i can figure out how i want to set it up so it cycles through a bunch of them
 <michael> but for now
 <michael> top 10
 <michael> kk sent
 <vance> What a terrible email address
 <vance> It's been a long time since I've seen such a bad one
 <vance> Like since the 5th grade
 <michael> oh i gounf iy
 <michael> oh ifound it*
 <ian> It's a burner 
 <ian> Like for things that require email
 <vance> That's ok
 <vance> I have like 15 emails I've used for Amazon prime
 <michael> vance
 <michael> for future reference
 <michael> 10minutemail.com
 <michael> creates a throwaway
 <michael> kills itself after 10 minutes
 <michael> but you can still use the email you created acc with
 <michael> to login
 <ian> Do you have a top 10 Mike 
 <michael> i have a notepad document with all my past amazon accts lol
 <michael> sec
 <michael> im almost done compiling and uploading
 <ian> Also this is what you sent me for drive 
 <michael> so theres actually
 <michael> 131 pics
 <michael> so
 <michael> its gonna be top 30 first
 <michael> then from top 30 we'll narrow it down
 <michael> or is 30 too many
 <michael> idk
 <vance> Let's go even slower
 <vance> Top 100
 <ian> 20 
 <ian> Because we can cut that to 10
 <ian> Other than 30 and cut it to 15 and then choose between the lesser 5
 <michael> VIEW ALL PHOTOS HERE: http://imgur.com/a/bl6yn VOTE on TOP 30 HERE: http://goo.gl/iejMBe

 <michael> I wonder if it's cheaper to buy it on dnm
 <michael> Or 3D print them 
 <michael> does Craigslist do guns 
 <ian> Wouldn't be surprised 
 <michael> ugh and I have to do paperwork 
 <ian> You should get a concealed weapon permit 
 <peter> It's your right as an American
 <michael> Fucking California gun laws
 <michael> A person must be at least 18 years of age to purchase a rifle or shotgun. To purchase a handgun, a person must be at least 21 years of age.

 <vance> Gerald Ford the 38th president 
 <angel> Ya dingus
 <vance> Forreal
 <ian> This is Gerald 
 <ian> From google images 
 <vance> He looks like he touches boys
 <jacob> Hi gerald
 <ian> He likes long walks on the beach and talking to himself in his free time 
 <taylor> Hey gerald
 <ian> He also has a profound collection of little boys hair he collects from the school he teaches at 
 <vance> All from their heads, of course
 <vance> These boys are much too young for hair anywhere else
 <ian> When Gerald is feeling a little on edge he takes slab dabs and drinks a 40 
 <angel> Helli Gerald
 <angel> O
 <ian> Some may call him "hip" or "cool" 
 <ian> Many call him a "monster" 
 <vance> He's still quite "in touch" with the younger generation
 <ian> Gerald doesn't understand these accusations of pedophelia or the "molesting of young children" 
 <jacob> Hella Gerald
 <ian> In his defense Gerald says, "I just want to feel closer to the children. There's nothing wrong with physical and mental support from their teacher" 
 <angel> Man Gerald you a buster
 <jacob> Feeling Gerald as eff right now
 <vance> Gerald has a more hands on teaching style 
 <vance> Gerald is feeling you as eff too
 <ian> "Timmy doesn't sleep at night anymore. All he does is scream in his sleep and says "Gerald" multiple times. I'm frightened for my child's safety" 
 <vance> Timmy is just restless from the interesting lessons he has been receiving 
 <angel> Gerald's methods are unconventional, sure. But he gets results
 <ian> The ongoing investigation leads to Gerald living a very normal life with no red flags pointing towards these charges
 <ian> He is a free man 
 <ian> No one can stop Gerald 
 <ian> Gerald is love 
 <ian> Gerald is life 
 <vance> Hail Gerald
 <vance> He will lead the nudist colony
 <vance> Personally heading the education system 
 <vance> Hail
 <angel> He grazed my nipple and whispered in my ear, "hail Gerald"

 <jacob> Harley had a big adventure this morning
 <jacob> I followed him as he went around searching for somewhere to poop; I could tell he needed to poop because he was frantic
 <jacob> He checked the dirt by all the plants near the wall but it was too shallow
 <jacob> Dug around, still too shallow
 <jacob> He ends up in the grass and finally digs deep enough
 <jacob> And proceeds to poop next to the hole. And then covers it thinly with grass. And forgets where it is afterward and steps in it on his way back.
 <vance> Ocat

 <michael> Opportunity almost got stuck in Martian soil on its way to Victoria Crater
 <michael> That gif is over a span of 5ish days 
 <jacob> Huh
 <jacob> I wonder if martian sinkholes are a thing
 <peter> You go Lil robo
 <michael> To think how close it came to them just being like "Well.. Shit." and then turning it into a stationary research station 
 <peter> They'd be like well, at least we know that this area here is dirt
 <michael> Altho to be fair it wouldn't be that devastating
 <michael> I guess it was originally slated for a 90 day mission 
 <michael> And it's been running strong for like almost 12 years now 
 <peter> America works, it never stops Mike
 <jacob> It gives valuable insight as to the sediment of that particular square meter of Martian land

 <michael> S
 <michael> Jk pooperino
 <peter> Long (poop)
 <angel> Anyone know if vc is open on Saturdays/from when to when?
 <vance> Yeah I think I read something like that online before 
 <angel> Dang. I need to clear these gay prerequisites for courses that don't need prerequisites
 <vance> Whens your registration?
 <vance> Ogod I didn't check if I need to do that
 <angel> Yesterday at 5am
 <vance> O mang
 <vance> Mine isn't till tues
 <jacob> Oh shit
 <jacob> For next semester?
 <michael> Haha oh god 
 <michael> Smame 
 <michael> It always sneaks up 
 <ian> Wait when is ours 
 <michael> Probably any time now 
 <michael> I bet you yours is right now Ian go check 
 <ian> Fuuuuu
 <vance> Kiersten was like last weekend
 <ian> Lol 3 days ago 
 <vance> Man what the heck
 <vance> Is registration dates random
 <vance> How do you get earlier ones
 <michael> Well I'm pretty sure it's all staggered within one time frame depending on like how many semesters you've had and some other factors 
 <ian> This is the earlier ones 
 <michael> I know you can apply for ACCESS stuff and if you get it you get like a super early registration time 
 <ian> New students don't register until the 23rd
 <michael> Yeah these are the priority ones but there's even sooner ones for ACCESS 
 <michael> You can actually do it for mental health. The health lady told me it's really good for people who get anxiety and shit because then there's no worry and you can get all your classes
 <michael> I've seriously considered applying but haven't gotten around to it 
 <michael> Also my date is in 4 days 
 <michael> Bless 
 <michael> Or not bless I suppose 
 <michael> But hey at least I don't feel like I'm late :p
 <ian> A lot of classes are open haha I'm going through it all
 <michael> Ofc 
 <michael> We're better than everyone because we already had at least 1 semester 
 <vance> Have you guys looks at the TAG requirements?
 <vance> If you already have a set major
 <vance> There's an agreement you can make with UCs maybe other schools too
 <vance> But if you take all the required classes and get a certain GPA
 <vance> It's auto accept
 <vance> Austin Hammond has it with UCSB already he just has to have a 3.2
 <angel> Rip didn't make it in time. 
 <angel> http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/files/tag-matrix.pdf
 <michael> You talking about guaranteed acceptance? 
 <michael> Hell yeah m8 education is gr8 they want us to be big men 
 <angel> filing period is over this year so you'd have to wait for next year to transfer fall of 2017
 <angel> rip ian
 <ian> Y me 
 <vance> Lol rip
 <vance> O rip
 <angel> you can talk to councelors about moving up your registration date i feel
 <vance> Nvm TAG
 <angel> not entirely sure but you should talk to them anyway
 <peter> You got to know when to hold them, you have to know when to fold them (smile)
 <vance> O wait
 <vance> I was gonna transfer 2017 anyway
 <vance> Ok I gotta figure out a major lol
 <peter> I'm gonna stay at cc forever
 <michael> Mfw I haven't had a real full fledged counselor appointment ever 
 <peter> Like the guy from community 
 <angel> keep in mind you need to complete 60 transferable units to fulfull tag requirements
 <angel> ive only ever gone to clear prerequisites
 <angel> every semester
 <angel> super gay
 <michael> I've been recommended from peeps who've been through the loop to meet with counselor at least once semester to make sure you're on track. There's always that dumb shit where it's like 1 class your missing or w.e
 <michael> Classic Mike not following his own advise 
 <michael> Rip my academic career
 <michael> Who needs real counselor appt 
 <michael> In the past I've just abused the drop in counselors 
 <michael> Because cuck making an appt like a month in advance 
 <michael> Their like "WELL YOU REALLY NEED TO MAKE AN APPT TO DO THIS ACTION IM JUST HERE FOR SIMPLE STUFF BUT CUZ YOUR HERE ILL DO IT THIS ONE TIME"
 <michael> Theyre* 
 <vance> UNIVERSITY OF VENTURA
 <angel> E. pluribus anus
 <vance> Angel if I'm following the assist.org do you think that's ok?
 <angel> yea you'll be fine im sure
 <vance> Kk
 <vance> Just like random smaller classes aren't transferable right?
 <michael> "yea you'll be fine im sure" - Famous Last Words Angel Castaneda 
 <angel> you can check which classes are transferable on the uc transfer planner thinger
 <angel> https://uctap.universityofcalifornia.edu/students/
 <angel> and the college catalogue should also tell you i think
 <angel> transfer planner's super uesful for this
 <vance> Angel do you know if we have to take foreign language for igetc
 <vance> Did 3 yrs Spanish at rio
 <michael> Photo cred pete 
 <michael> I did some sweet edits to the fade and contrast 
 <taylor> U smell me
 <peter> I can smell my (finger)
 <jacob> Vance
 <jacob> No language needed if you did it in highschool
 <jacob> Unless it's related to your major
 <vance> Swaggy ty
 <michael> I should code in another language and then translate it prior to compile time so nobody can steal my secrets 
 <jacob> Vance
 <vance> Ya
 <jacob> I too am 2017 transfer man
 <jacob> Fu k majorz
 <jacob> Who need 
 <ian> Me too but I started late 
 <jacob> No me
 <vance> I think we're all 2017 transfer except angel
 <angel> yall a bunch of slowpokes
 <vance> Lol if I had paid attention to what I was doing I could have had tag to UCSC for 2016
 <vance> Goddam
 <angel> rip
 <peter> Wow good job
 <angel> its okay rocky, you go when you feel like it
 <jacob> if I could figure the fuck out what ahm doing me too
 <jacob> I think the only igetc I don't have after this semester is math
 <jacob> it's just gonna be filler credits for like a year
 <jacob> I'll probably take a semester off at some point
 <jacob> Vance lets volunteer together and join some program
 <jacob> Let's go to africa
 <jacob> No UC could deny us if we went to Africa
 <ian> True
 <ian> Take some pics with kids 
 <peter> Can I join?
 <vance> True my sister got denied by Harvard bc she didn't go to Africa 
 <michael> I'm down for groupwatch peace corp 
 <ian> We can do acid or shrooms in an African desert 
 <ian> And then probably kill each other 
 <michael> That would be wacky especially with all the kids with distended stomachs 
 <vance> Looool the only class I need for tag at SC is stats
 <vance> Could've been done
 <vance> Ripperino
 <michael> GG
 <angel> are you still engineering major vance
 <michael> Yah I'm gonna be in CC forever 
 <vance> I think econ
 <jacob> Is OK Vance ur saving money
 <jacob> I mean
 <jacob> Not really
 <michael> Especially cuz I essentially took off last semester by medic withdrawing 
 <vance> Ya not rlly lol
 <jacob> But you could be :)
 <angel> i mean you'll still probably need 2 years at uni
 <vance> Probs 3 lets be honest 
 <peter> 6
 <michael> Isn't that like the average 
 <michael> I read that somewhere 
 <vance> It used to be said 2 years CC 2 years Uni
 <vance> But ya I think avg is 3 and 3
 <ian> Seems reasonable 
 <vance> Mike u gotta start your math lol
 <vance> Ur major requires lots of it to transfer 
 <michael> orly 
 <angel> is your starting from calc 1 you'll probably need 4 concurrent semesters to cover all your maths
 <angel> or at least 3
 <michael> 4 is what I came to as well 
 <michael> Thx for the info Vance 
 <michael> I never realized computers run on math b4
 <angel> you can do 3 if you take linear algebra and differentials when you're taking calc 1 and 2
 <vance> Lololol
 <michael> That sounds pretty gross 
 <angel> it's really not bad at all
 <vance> Kiers is doing that next semester I think
 <michael> Hm I will consider it 
 <michael> But yah I can't get away with not even having calc under my belt yet lmao 
 <michael> I'm like hey I'm more familiar with programming and computer shit 
 <michael> But these fuckers are a bunch of MATH NERDS 
 <michael> who woulda thunk it 
 <angel> math is good for you
 <michael> Agree
 <michael> Purest best science 
 <vance> That's what I keep telling myseld
 <vance> But I still can't get myself to get into it
 <michael> I like doing it too it's just I lost my mathiness somewhere senior year
 <vance> Angel can you tutor me for extra credit assignment sometime in future
 <michael> When I didn't take calc after Precalc junior yr
 <angel> sure
 <vance> It's not due until second to last week of semester
 <vance> Tyty
 <angel> is this differentials or calc 3
 <vance> Calc 1 lol
 <michael> I'd be embarrassed to be tutored tbh I feel like I'm just so out of practice in terms of the continuum of calc stuff 
 <vance> I was too
 <vance> Until I took calc 1 for the third time
 <michael> xd 
 <michael> My brother did same 
 <vance> O wait I just realized I need more math for tag
 <vance> Ok now I don't feel so bad
 <vance> Except I could've done if I didn't suck for 2 semester in a row
 <vance> Ripperino x2
 <michael> I 4got angel have you taken discrete math yet 
 <angel> taking it next semester
 <michael> Math commiseration party

Or if you just wanna do beachy stuff and not move we can go to somewhere like silverstrand. There's also lots of places along the Pacific Coast Highway to hotbox and watch the sunset. We can do any combination of those things "
 <michael> Did I miss anything else exciting here 
 <vance> LACMA / Getty if she likes that sort of thang

 <michael> It was actually super nice it smelled amazing and was very spacy and relaxed

 <jacob> Literally santano
 <peter> Wizard
 <peter> When you don't eat all day
 <michael> Anyone want to buy a Logitech G502 Proteus Core unused for 42.99
 <peter> Mich is going pro 
 <peter> Fps
 <michael> You can disable them all. Also according to reviews it's actually really hard to accidentally hit but idk if big hands prob
 <jacob> Does it have claw grip attachment?
 <peter> Does it work with ambidextrous (magic)
 <michael> No attachment. I took it out of box already though and I am claw grip and it's super comfy on my right hand 
 <michael> No petr
 <michael> That's the joke 
 <michael> I'm actually retarded
 <michael> I am right handed but I prefer using my mouse lefty most of time and especially when gaming 
 <michael> Hence this blunder 
 <peter> That's why you're bad
 <peter> Taylor probably does the same thing
 <peter> I use my feet
 <taylor> I use my butt
 <peter> Your hands and fingers are little butts
 <jacob> Wussat
 <jacob> H OLLY FUCK I LOVE SIONS
 <jacob> SUPERHERO ARMOR ANY 1??
 <peter> Nanobot tech
 <ian> You know, this shooting was probably bound to happen 
 <peter> Yeah
 <peter> Isis
 <jacob> What shooting
 <jacob> ?
 <ian> Tri-county developmental services is beyond irresponsible with patients and providing services for the disabled
 <ian> My brother included. 
 <peter> In San Bernardino 
 <peter> 12 dead 20 victims
 <ian> Yup
 <ian> Still sad and shouldn't have happened but 
 <ian> O well
 <jacob> Did they target the employees or the disabled?
 <ian> The employees from what I've heard 
 <peter> I'm (happy) it's (no) (me)
 <michael> I have had a subconjunctival hemorrhage
 <ian> 14 dead
 <ian> 1 suspect deceased 
 <ian> 1 still in the vehicle and 1 has not been found 
 <vance> What's the main differences between lsd and shrooms trip
 <jacob> Clearer thinking (as in your thoughts and focuses aren't as random I guess) maybe less str8up euphoria
 <jacob> Different visuals
 <vance> That's lsd?
 <jacob> Aye
 <vance> What about introspection
 <jacob> Possibly more since you are more focused. Kinda depends on what you're up to
 <jacob> And it will be more coherent
 <jacob> But it can be intense still
 <vance> Oisee
 <vance> Sonam and them really wanna drop over break lol
 <jacob> nice
 <jacob> In terms of introspection, I think anyone would be fine or even feel better as long as they aren't actively suppressing something that's really bothering them
 <jacob> (Anyone who is mentally stable that is)
 <vance> Lolol I getchu
 <jacob> Nothing to worry about I say
 <vance> Sonam really wants to get deep and find his inner self lol
 <jacob> Having not had the time to try meditation/deep introspection on lsd, I dunno, but from what I hear if you want it and embrace it then it is gr8
 <vance> I hope Sonam comes out full hippy
 <jacob> Sometimes you can get stuck on a negative thought or get into thought loops but mostly that is caused by anxiety and can be overcome or put aside
 <jacob> With positivity 
 <jacob> lol me too
 <jacob> He's almost there
 <jacob> Sonam is my favorite person btw
 <jacob> I wish he was my dad
 <vance> Sonam already looks the dad part
 <vance> Sonam would be the funniest dad to watch
 <vance> I think he would be in constant shock of how fucked up little kids are
 <jacob> Nah his kids would be timid lil fuks and he would comfort them in his dadly ways
 <vance> I'll set you guys up on a date
 <jacob> Just 2 single dads
 <jacob> Going out for some beers
 <jacob> Nothing gay about that
 <jacob> Lmao I just realized the glass on my front cam is broken

 <michael> I will go 
 <michael> With you 
 <michael> If you want 
 <jacob> If you want
 <jacob> To come with me
 <vance> I think you'll like the martian more than spectre
 <jacob> You can

 <vance> But I enjoyed both very much
 <jacob> U know I am a huge Jim beans fan?
 <jacob> Does that factor in?
 <vance> Oh ya

 <jacob> But I still laugh at it like it is
 <angel> We should group watch season finale tomorrow
 <taylor> The gags r pretty amusing

 <taylor> Dumb idiots.com

 <vance> Original insult by Vance 
 <angel> tm
 <angel> verizon sent me a copyright infringement notice just for looking at it through line
 <taylor> Verizonsueme.org
 <vance> Who sent you the notice before?
 <vance> AMC?
 <angel> i got one for downloading an episode of louie 
 <angel> apparently just one even though i download whole season
 <angel> use protection guys 
 <taylor> I got one for bates motel but only season 3 ep 3 not every other ep
 <angel> the times are changing
 <angel> gotta use vpns
 <michael> 2 coppers at end of Jacob road @4way (stop)
 <michael> Sth happen
 <michael> :0
 <vance> Sith happen
 <taylor> Sponsored by disneys star wars the force awakens
 <taylor> Straw soresss
 <angel> no
 <taylor> But why
 <angel> no
 <taylor> But why
 <angel> we are now locked in eternal combat
 <angel> i hope your proud of yourself
 <taylor> Tfw u watch 12 eps of an anime bc ur friends said it was good
 <angel> Tfw ur friend is uncultured swine
 <angel> Did you really not like it tho?
 <vance> Watch space dandy u gay
 <taylor> No i really thought it was lame as heck
 <angel> What didn't you like about it?
 <taylor> We knew the punchline every ep
 <taylor> What did u like about it
 <michael> "Punchline" hehe
 <angel> Really you knew every joke before it happened
 <taylor> Most of the jokes were like one punch man survived a punch that nobody else did the whole ep 
 <taylor> I now he beat the guy that nobody else did 
 <taylor> Also it was still just all punching each other with like 1 gag thrown between every fight
 <taylor> Like if its parodying anime it didnt do anything to make anime better it was just like bad anime that felt like filler every episode which is the point but why
 <angel> Because it was able to do everything that popular shonen anime does and be better
 <taylor> How was it better 
 <taylor> the gags were funnier than other animes but like it doesnt matter if the writing is good if every other aspect of the show isnt that interesting
 <taylor> It was basically wwe raw to me except with less cool moves and a weaker plot
 <angel> It's able to present a lot of themes u see in other anime in a reasonable manner and us some of these themes to tell a fun story rather than dum fight story for kids
 <angel> I feel like you just didn't get the jokes if you feel that way
 <taylor> But that seemed like a dumb fight story for kids to me
 <taylor> Like it was still just good guy vs villain of the week
 <angel> Like that you think the story opm tells takes priority to the character interactions he has in a world of super serious anime fighters
 <taylor> Ya but why are we supposed to care about the super serious anime fighters?
 <angel> You're not. Your supposed to enjoy how opm doesn't fit in that world
 <taylor> Im gonna start space dandy now  but that was pretty much the first ive seen
 <taylor> Ya but thats like one gag aspect of the show that isnt that interesting bc the only reason he doesnt fit in is bc hes just more super saiyan than everyone without trying
 <taylor> I probably will i guess bc opm was 1/10
 <jacob> ^
 <jacob> I haven't watched all of it but yeah what I liked most was the subtle parodies of anime that are basically throughout the whole episode
 <jacob> You aren't supposed to get hyped for one punch man defeating the villain
 <taylor> But why not
 <taylor> That leaves subtle parodies to get hyped for
 <jacob> subtle parodies, not so subtle parodies, character interaction (which has its own parodies)
 <taylor> I just dont think the general lets just make jokes about anime idea they wrote around isnt enough to carry a whole show bc animes have nothing already
 <jacob> And maybe some people like the fights because they're tired of "omg massive enemy onstoppabru my character must build their strength for 40 minutes" while opm does nothing
 <taylor> Why is parody allowed to be lazy though?
 <taylor> Bc other anime is lazy
 <jacob> Drum roll, Tay thinks animes are all la-
 <jacob> Oh
 <taylor> The anime theyre making fun of is
 <taylor> Its still just obviously good character searching for and beating obviously bad character
 <jacob> so if it's a parody of that why are you so frustrated at its simplicity?
 <angel> the show isn't about the conflict between saitama or any of the heroes against another villain tho
 <taylor> Im not frustrated at simplicity just that it was doing what every other anime does and still creating lame filler
 <taylor> What show about
 <taylor> If not characters
 <angel> if anything it was about saitam being unfulfilled with his life 
 <jacob> ur so dumb
 <jacob> Right now
 <taylor> Why
 <taylor> U guys
 <taylor> Tell me ur favorite char from one punch man
 <angel> you don't have to like the show its understandable that you don't its not everyone brand
 <angel> but i think the reasons you don't like the show are dum
 <taylor> I know im not trying to convince u guys to dislike it 
 <taylor> But i think the reasons u like it r dum
 <angel> licenseless rider was my fav character tho
 <taylor> Big chin brat l even caught that his dad was the one who made hero association thats a cool gag
 <jacob> one of your plusses in a parody show is plot consistency or depth? ¿
 <angel> he was like the archetypal protagonist of any other shonen anime 
 <taylor> that was the most excited i got for the whole series when i saw that one easter egg
 <taylor> One of my plusses in any show are both those things parody doesnt have to mean making scary movie 123
 <angel> but the show isn't relying so heavily on parody as it is having these characters interact in interesting and fun ways 
 <taylor> Ya but the show was still mostly fight scenes and anime animations why not just fill the show with funny gags and cut out fight scenes? Or why not leave in only fight scenes no words now thatd be something
 <jacob> U should make a true definitive comedy anime starring Rob Lowe and Michael Fassbender
 <taylor> Also how hard would it have been to just kill off one of those lame class s guys
 <taylor> Like just batman at least
 <taylor> They were supposed to be lame anyway right?
 <taylor> Why not give them death
 <taylor> In the season finale 
 <taylor> Or through out the whole show
 <taylor> Or maybe s2 will have one ep where they all die except opm
 <angel> they were supposed to give you the laugh but u didn't take the laugh
 <angel> i was just thinking that
 <taylor> I was thinking that too
 <angel> we are one
 <taylor> I knew u would call me him
 <angel> i knew you were channeling him
 <taylor> But that guy was right opm is a fraud
 <taylor> That ep and whenever they met with the hero association made me cringe but was that ironically bad??
 <taylor> Also when mumen rider and bee stinger went to pick up citizens
 <taylor> I was like now thats what i call anime
 <angel> its supposed to be funny
 <angel> there's a level of irony that you missed
 <angel> i think that's the whole issue
 <taylor> Ya like its what every other hero in an anime would die
 <taylor> Do
 <angel> you mean the one with deep sea king
 <jacob> I bet Taylor likes Bee Movie
 <taylor> No i was talking about stingray and mumen being regular heros in last episode
 <jacob> lmao owned
 <taylor> Also why is that girl the only female character bc thats how other animes r?
 <taylor> Now she had some fun interesting interactions with opm
 <taylor> When she screamed at them like girls do lmao classic 
 <angel> that meme is still growing tay
 <angel> its not fair to judge yet
 <taylor> Is s2 confirmed?
 <angel> its probably gonna be a thing
 <taylor> O ya its growing alright (smirk)
 <angel> did they confirm season 2 at the end of 12
 <angel> ?
 <taylor> I pretty much closed right after credits
 <angel> i mean like that's the start of her character arc tay 
 <angel> i checked every episode
 <taylor> What is gonna happen season 2
 <angel> i was surprised by the lack of marvel tie ins
 <taylor> They rly should have been like "one punch man will return" after the credits
 <taylor> No i think itd be like a good prody of james bond which is like british anime so they could fit it in
 <vance> Satires aren't funny if you aren't invested in what they're making fun of
 <vance> Like you can still understand it but it just wont be funny
 <vance> Like inside jokes are only funny to people involved
 <angel> ^
 <taylor> So u like it bc it was a meta take on anime? Like its self aware right
 <angel> yea
 <angel> also on superhero movies
 <taylor> But i just think if the meta humor isnt enough to carry the plot then isnt it just any other anime with meta humor sprinkled in
 <vance> U don't have to be into anime to like space dandy tay
 <vance> Pls watch
 <vance> Pls tay
 <angel> but it was enough to carry the plot for me
 <angel> just not you
 <vance> It's been over a yr
 <vance> Tay pls
 <vance> Pls tay
 <vance> Tay
 <vance> Pls
 <taylor> Also inside jokes arent funny on tv
 <vance> Space dandy
 <vance> Tay
 <angel> i also recommend to you fullmetal alchemist brotherhood tay
 <taylor> Ok i m gonna watch it and im not gonna let opm muddle my opinion of anime more than other animes
 <vance> Space dandy
 <vance> Dandy in spave
 <vance> Pls
 <angel> if you don't like that one then i'd be convinced you just don't like Japanese cartoons in general
 <vance> I'd be convinced you're a racist
 <taylor> Except now i blew my load too early on opm i gotta wait at least another yr to intake anime
 <vance> And you only hang out with me so you don't feel racist
 <vance> Bc I'm the only Asian person
 <vance> I'm the token asian
 <vance> That's what I'll think if you don't like space dandy 
 <taylor> Ill watch it if u guys sign my petition to get opm taken off the air for good
 <angel> there's an alternate universe out there where we're all Japanese and tay doesn't like rick and morty 
 <ian> All of your opinions are bad but I appreciate everyone creating a intellectual conversation from a GOOD anime 
 <taylor> Opm is no rnm
 <ian> An*
 <taylor> Even angels opinions were bad?
 <ian> Everyone's. 
 <angel> its not the best analogy

 <michael> oh SHIT

 <ian> Then the woman goes to walk out and yells at one of them "and I fucking hate Mexicans!"
 <ian> She walks out, then comes back in and throws her smoothie right in the middle of fucking everything 
 <ian> Me and the Mexican lady walk out to follow her and I'm yelling at her to leave and she says "go fuck yourself I want my money back!"

 <michael> In case you guys were wondering about the conclusion to the epic 2 month saga that was getting the replacement for my DOA motherboard 
 <michael> I called today, spoke directly to a supervisor, and had it resolved within 30 seconds 
 <taylor> Today was beach day
 <michael> The reasoning he gave me is that it was notated that I needed to return 2X CPU bracket, 1X I/O backplate shield 
 <michael> But apparently they notated incorrectly as 2X CPU bracket, 1X I/o shield, 1X MOBO backplate 
 <michael> So even after they received the additional pieces, they fucked up and thought I didn't Send it
 <michael> Rather than tell me this I had to find this out after trying to contact them with varying degrees of success for the past month
 <michael> But yeah they ended up rejecting my return and see in the process of sending the original back to me
 <michael> But the supervisor was like " I will do my best to stop that from happening and will ship you out a replacement now" 
 <michael> here's hoping this one isn't DOA too lmao 
 <angel> Ill pray for ur mobos safe deliverance
 <vance> Today was a beach day

 <jacob> But we just chilled 
 <jacob> And then a twitch streamer I played with before showed up and was talking to Kanye non stop and wouldn't shut up
 <jacob> Like I was pissed, he was hogging Kanye
 <jacob> And then I woke up, fell asleep and was in a new dream
 <jacob> Was at the airport with my mom and bought a plane ticket, but wanted to upgrade to first class. So I gave the ticket man an extra $3, making the ticket cost $16 total

 <michael> so uh 
 <michael> you guys still hanging out 
 <vance> Omg
 <vance> I made Amazon ACC for prime trial
 <vance> I forgot to cancel prime
 <vance> Now I can't remember the email address
 <vance> No it is not
 <vance> I used that first semester
 <vance> You can use any email for free 1 month
 <vance> I make a new email every month
 <vance> Rip $100
 <michael> well even if it's already happened they let you cancel it 
 <michael> you still got time you just gotta figure out which email 
 <vance> Yeah Ive been trying to guess
 <vance> I think it has something to do with symphony or February
 <vance> I've just been typing all kinds of names into Gmail create ACC so it will tell me if it exist 
 <vance> But me being smart didn't link the email to phone or other email
 <michael> ok well you only logged into it on your computer right?
 <michael> if you go into your browser history 
 <michael> and search "@gmail.com"
 <michael> it should show up 
 <vance> Yah but I did it in incognito so I don't have to log out of my actual email lol
 <michael> because it preserves the email in the link 
 <michael> LOL
 <michael> GG
 <vance> I am real sad boy
 <vance> I've tried so many emails
 <vance> This is real karma
 <vance> I've been doing this for so many years
 <vance> No nate
 <vance> I deserve this
 <vance> I am true sinner
 <vance> I must repent 
 <vance> I called customer support but they can't do anything w/o email lol
 <vance> If they charged by the month I could just get a new card but they charge for the whole year at a time
 <jacob> Should be some way to determine what the email is from the fact it's charging you. What Nate said.
 <jacob> Just dispute the payment via your bank acct?
 <vance> Nates way is the only way I could think off
 <vance> But that's like a ton of work
 <vance> And it's not a mess up on their end
 <vance> I feel like I have to repent 
 <vance> And burn for my sins
 <jacob> Its $100 breoh
 <jacob> You could buy $100 worth of gold with that and be one step ahead of everyone else
 <vance> Yeuhhh I guess
 <vance> But bday money I didn't have to work for lol
 <jacob> yo $100 isn't chump change ya fool
 <vance> I guess I should lol
 <jacob> Smhwismd

 <jacob> He was like convincing me to make fake emails for Amazon prime lol
 <vance> Ok it is
 <vance> Just if you're not stupid about it
 <vance> Of you cancel immediately than you still get the whole month but it won't extend
 <vance> I forgot though:(

 <jacob> Yo dudes take online logic class w/me
 <jacob> 4 wk
 <jacob> We studybuddy and get ez 3 creds
 <jacob> (so ez)
 <vance> I alrdy over unitz so it won't be transferable for me 
 <peter> Is it just credits or does it meet a requirment?
 <vance> Depends on your major
 <vance> I don't think it's a typical GED though 
 <vance> But it could be good GPA boost
 <jacob> It is a GED UC/CSU transferable course
 <jacob> Philosophy intro to Logic
 <jacob> Its not gonna be necessarily easy either
 <vance> Olol I thought it was a math course 
 <jacob> But not hard. Just condensed into 4 weeks
 <jacob> How many credits have you completed Vance? U mean over in general or just for summer?
 <vance> In general
 <vance> I'm not sure so far but with my current plan I'll have almost 90 when I transfer
 <vance> Only 60 are transferable
 <jacob> 90 is the limit right? For UCs?
 <vance> I think 60-70
 <vance> Iike I can still take classes but I just wont get the credit that go toward graduation at wherever I transfer
 <peter> Lol I take classes for funz
 <vance> And when I transfer Id have to take certain amount of units anyway
 <peter> J what is the code for the class?

 <vance> Sorry sarcasm always works in non tonal mediums 
 <peter> Power up (fam) 
 <vance> Zoinks
 <vance> Are you taking any other courses over summer?
 <vance> I was thinking about maybe taking sign language 
 <jacob> Intro to mass communications, 4wk online. Idk. Might drop it. it Probably super general and gay assfuck
 <jacob> There weren't that many available this summer at MP
 <jacob> Btw Pete it says it's closed but I talked to the prof. in person and he said he still wanted people to sign up.. So idk
 <peter> Sign language sounds cool
 <peter> Lol
 <peter> Should I chat with him directly? 
 <jacob> Yeah u should reach out if u sign up. Maybe he's anticipating people dropping or just allowing extra people
 <jacob> Or ask before signing up
 <vance> Have you taken any comms classes yet Jake?
 <vance> Does that count as speech?
 <jacob> Have not, and I don't think they do
 <jacob> Its,not about communicating, it's about media and shit
 <jacob> This class specifically
 <jacob> Communicating personally rather
 <vance> Ok side note
 <vance> I had this speech prof
 <vance> And he was really good at teaching speech and I admired him for that
 <vance> He was kinda a jackass but it was w/e
 <vance> Turns out he just got fired bc he was writing things in girls papers
 <vance> Like he thinks they're pretty and have nice legs
 <vance> But besides that I thought speech was pretty fun
 <peter> What's wrong with telling ladies that their aesthetics appeal to me, why would I care about their actual papera?
 <peter> Why would their be papers in the first place?
 <peter> It's speech.
 <vance> Apparently he only did that to Asian girls
 <vance> I'm really glad he got fired when he did bc I definitely recommend him to Kiersten 
 <peter> Asian persuasion
 <vance> Forreal
 <vance> Aside from that he was really good at teaching speech 
 <ian> Silver tongue 
 <vance> He really did though he was good at talking
 <taylor> Thats bc hes a psycho
 <taylor> U got seduced baby
 <taylor> U gotta forget everything he taught u
 <vance> Aw man
 <vance> What do I do
 <vance> How do I do that
 <vance> I fell for it I didn't even know
 <jacob> U gotta shield yourself. U are particularly vulnerable to older men
 <vance> How did you know I liked older men
 <vance> Anyone get a massage before? Would ya recommend?
 <ian> Depends on where you go. Lu's in Old Town is pretty great 
 <vance> What's the pricing, do you remember?

 <ian> Now, sad dads, what we do is beautiful interlocking paving stone that not only works for driveways but also for patios, pool decks, and walkways 
 <peter> C u there
 <ian> We also offer beautiful outdoor lighting which can increase the safety and beauty of your home. In addition, we have the most realistic synthetic turf available, which not only stays lush and green year round, but can save you up to 70% on your water bill. On top of all of that we offer some phenomenal bbq's, fire pits, water features, and patio cover pergolas 
 <jacob> Yo now do it without the adjectives
 <ian> That's impossible. 
 <jacob> If I was a customer and said that, wwyd?
 <jacob> This is good practice

 <vance> Is that a real thing?
 <jacob> Think so yeah

 <jacob> Based on the tv show Entourage
 <michael> exactly
 <vance> Does the entourage effect work if I haven't seen it?
 <michael> the ent-ou-rage FX
 <michael> terpenes + cannabinoids > cannabinoids alone
 <michael> heres some science
 <michael> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrcene
 <michael> actually thats a wikipedia link
 <michael> http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01238.x/pdf
 <michael> this is the science
 <michael> basically myrcene helps pass drugz through the blood brain barrier easier
 <michael> its also in hops, eucalyptus and lemongrass so make a salad while ur at it
 <vance> Nice thx for the science

 <michael> ok im back from sleep to give you more mostly accurate summaries
 <michael> its better if its ripe
 <michael> no canned or dried bullshit
 <michael> i read that asian mangos are better than western mangos
 <michael> idk if thats tru but you should go to asian food market and test that
 <michael> also its not going to be like a huge game changing thing
 <michael> but the FX r real

 <angel> abridged versions cut off like 600 pages of material
 <peter> I'd like hang, maybe in 2 hours
 <jacob> Versions shouldn't differ too much. And certainly not in terms of plot
 <angel> its a matter of better adapting the story to modern English 
 <angel> I hear people like the penguin classics for this reason
 <jacob> You'll see more relatable words, like "sup bro"
 <jacob> I am out of papers
 <peter> Buy off amazon
 <vance> Wait I'm bad at reading modern English

 <vance> I captured the gyms at the harbor on break
 <vance> Within 5 mins ppl took it
 <vance> Everyone in line at the ice cream shop was playing lol
 <hunter> Its pretty hard to keep a gym, has to be a huge group of us
 <hunter> To keep it ours at least. That or sit there for like an hour and grind  
 <vance> Some friends of mine conquered the dog park by my house
 <vance> I'm going to add a Pokemon when I have time
 <vance> We're trying to take cam by taking city hall

 <nina> I evolved a pidgey hehe
 <ian> Pidgey grind
 <taylor> Does evolving make then much stronger? I just wanna power up my poke till i have ultimate strength charmander evolutions frkn hard
 <ian> Yeah just save up the candies. Each Pokemon you catch gives you 3 and if you transfer them that's 4. So it's a hard grind but worth
 <vance> It doubled the level
 <vance> For me
 <vance> So I think if you level a lot then evolve is he strongest
 <ian> Yeah evolve is best

 <vance> I just put a 198 rhyhorn at the dog park
 <vance> Really?

 <jacob> When you've been trapped in a blizzard for 2 weeks, the smell of a man cookin' ain't too far from roast venison, y'hear? Yer mouth waters all the same. When yer stomach is feedin' on itself, it takes bites outta that little preconceived notion in yer head 'bout the value of that human flesh. Let's just say, between ya and me, that if I ain't the first one who closes his eyes and claims his own right to eternal warmth, then I ain't goin' on hungry neither.

 <jacob> Hay
 <jacob> We're gonna hang @ my place in like 30 mins and get tournt
 <jacob> Come hang ifuwant
 <ian> How long hang? 
 <jacob> Uhh idk
 <jacob> Indefinite
 <ian> I'll check in around  
 <michael> there was some accident at the 4way stop by your house Jacob 
 <michael> firetruck and co was thar
 <nina> Yeah Peter and I just saw it while working 
 <nina> They were working on getting someone out of the car
 <nina> Looked like he/she was okay though which is good
 <nina> You guys gonna be hanging for a bit?
 <jacob> Yes maam
 <vance> This is the brand I got
 <vance> I still don't know what live resin is
 <ian> It was v nice 
 <vance> But I'll Google it later lol
 <hunter> Pretty sure live resin is resin heads extracted when the plant is still fresh 
 <vance> The side of the box says it's not extracted with a solution 
 <vance> I wonder what the technique is like behind it
 <hunter> "a solution" 
 <vance> Weed science is so advance lol
 <hunter> Solution or solvent?
 <hunter> And important! You're inhaling dat shit
 <vance> Lmao solvent
 <vance> It says it's molecularly extracted 
 <vance> I just took chem too lmao
 <vance> This is a hybrid but I guess still pretty much sativa lol
 <hunter> Live resin is totally butane extracted 
 <hunter> But has like %2 higher terp content due to fresh Material used 
 <hunter> My theory is once you start puffing it, the flavor will deteriorate pretty rapidly from the first inhalation 
 <hunter> I'm talking like over days of use of course 
 <vance> Ooo interesting 
 <vance> What is different about butane vs other solvents 
 <vance> Like pros and cons 
 <hunter> Pretty much the chemical signature left on the product
 <hunter> Science is kinda still out on the pros and cons 
 <vance> What's your favorite in your experience 
 <hunter> But it usually comes down to how badly it will irrigate your throat. Some people are allergic to butane or co2 and they have pretty violent reactions. Thus leaving them towards solventless or at the least a different solvent extraction
 <hunter> Honestly nothing compares to rosin 
 <hunter> And I'm sure rosin with terps reintroduce would be the end game 
 <hunter> As for solvent based oils 
 <vance> Or at least the golden standard 
 <hunter> Live resin seems to be the least harsh for me 
 <vance> Eventually buying less than that will be like buying Mexican brick weed
 <hunter> Yeah pretty much
 <vance> Yeah I dont have a lot of experience with it but pete and ian had similar reaction 
 <vance> I think it has very low vaporization temp
 <hunter> If you can handle that slight solvent burn and have proper access to the product, you can't get much better than live resin 
 <vance> The box said it may leak at 100°+
 <hunter> Absolutely, you want to keep it quite low 
 <hunter> The hotter you cook it, the more chemicals in the oil change 
 <vance> The battery I bought has 3 temp settings 
 <vance> I'm at the middle one should I put it at the lowest you think?
 <vance> Hahahaha dope
 <hunter> You going to get v stoned
 <vance> Yeah I was pretty much dead yesterday at Jake's hahaha
 <ian> Same haha
 <vance> U cats wanna play secret Hitler 
 <ian> When?
 <vance> Idk when are you guys free?
 <vance> Half our boys prob won't wake up till like 4
 <jacob>  Be there soon
 <ian> Probably later afternoon for me
 <vance> Kk sounds fly
 <vance> Lol
 <michael> what secret hitler 
 <vance> Let's play later
 <peter> Hitler
 <vance> Yo was poppin
 <vance> Finishing up with errands about to meet up with djtorr
 <vance> What're u guys doing
 <nina> Have you walked the doggies yet tonight?
 <ian> My mom took them tonight already I'm pretty sure 
 <nina> Ah I see
 <nina> Well I think I might take Frank for one soon, he's super excited rn
 <ian> Yeah they went already 
 <nina> No worries! Maybe hang after walk? 
 <nina> Cool, I think Peter is joining me for the walk anyways
 <vance> Me and Ettore are at tays 
 <nina> Guys tonight Clover walked a mile in 30 min nonstop for the first time im so proud
 <nina> And even on a leash 
 <michael> What a beast
 <jacob> Real human bean
 <jacob> And a real hero.
 <nina> I know it's like shes a real dog
 <michael> STAY HYDRATED Y'ALL
 <ian> For real those Santa Anna's 
 <michael> Anyone wanna get brunch 
 <vance> I would've said yes if I checked my phone
 <vance> And if I didn't just eat
 <vance> And if I actually liked you
 <ian> So Hoss is a Daniff 
 <ian> 35in legs concluded that
 <ian> Not legs but legs to back
 <vance> Hoss is a big ass dog
 <vance> Big ass legs concluded that 
 <peter> (leg) 
 <ian> Once he starts putting on some weight 
 <vance> Ur gonna release him into the mountains?
 <vance> Do you guys know how much it cost to rent a cabin at big bear or somewhere similar is?
 <vance> Thatd a (tight) friend get away 
 <vance> And u can call bring ur doggies 
 <ian> My family has cabin in mammoth but we can only use at the end of January 
 <vance> How much "can" is there in "we can"
 <ian> I guess we're tight with the people that own it
 <ian> Idk lol just have to ask
 <michael> I can ask my bro how much the cabin was for his bachelors
 <michael> that was a super nice place
 <peter> Ian ask
 <michael> the place we stayed at was $260 a night. it was 2 stories, 3 king size beds in seperate rooms, big living room, hot tub and grill
 <michael> they charge more in the summer or ski season, but right now its pretty cheap
 <michael> also the place we had was pretty luxurious, we could definitely get something smaller
 <michael> https://www.tripadvisor.com/VacationRentalReview-g32073-d3577727-Pilot_s_Chalet_in_Big_Bear_Close_to_the_Lake-Big_Bear_City_Big_Bear_Region_California.html
 <michael> this was the palce. damn its $150 right now
 <peter> We should cabin and summit. 
 <hunter> The big 5 by rite aid has huge deals if you guys want to get your gear now 
 <hunter> It would be much cheaper
 <peter> Anyone want to get some Ramen? 
 <peter> Trump isn't doing well at all
 <ian> Real (poop)
 <jacob> This is comedy
 <ian> Truly 
 <peter> Prime time TV
 <vance> They are both so cringey
 <vance> Trump is based off decker 
 <jacob> I just went on r/the_donald
 <jacob> There is a thread praising every sentence and look he makes lmao
 <angel> its hot in Topeka tho
 <michael> (why)(hot) (no)(sun)?
 <angel> same
 <vance> Hot in (toe) (pick)uh
 <michael> sounds like I'm rly missing out on some quality television 
 <vance> Has trump spoken about any of the topics yet
 <vance> Will he ever
 <ian> It's hard to understand what he's saying 
 <jacob> He has tried, in the usual vague, subversive way, and then defaults to calling out Clinton
 <vance> I wish Hilary would stop trying so hard to be sassy
 <vance> It's so cringey
 <vance> I miss Obama 
 <jacob> Hillary is annoying but I feel like the alternative is her looking pissed off or morbid
 <ian> Media suggested she smiled more 
 <ian> In turn it's equally as bad 
 <peter> Their both bad
 <nina> Is it bad that I feel like Trump is making Hillary look good?
 <ian> They're* 
 <jacob> Nah Nina, he is
 <taylor> Prob debating trump makes u feel pretty sassy
 <vance> That's true
 <nina> He just doesn't know enough 
 <vance> I prob couldn't resist 
 <hunter> It's clear trump has never played civ before 
 <ian> If I was interrupted that many times I would be 
 <nina> He just is acting like an upset highschooler to me
 <peter> He's the one on Civ to go for military and fight city states.
 <peter> War monger
 <taylor> Trump has been sassier he tells off the mod more than her
 <vance> Yeah but u should just know hes dumb and ignore him
 <taylor> But thats not what debates r
 <ian> Yes
 <vance> Well debates aren't talking about Hilary for every question 
 <ian> I need policies and plans not what the other ISNT doing 
 <ian> Specifics 
 <jacob> I don't think he understands what they're there for
 <taylor> They r if one candidate doesnt have policies to talk abt
 <ian> True
 <vance> No it still isn't!2!2!2!
 <jacob> Stfu shillary u can't actually see me!!!
 <jacob> I think she made eye contact :£
 <hunter> This is the mind control part 
 <ian> "Fact checkers" comments keep killing me
 <taylor> That was fun tv 
 <ian> I have like 20min left 
 <jacob> Haha I can't wait until the presidential gladitorial pit!
 <vance> Shut up tay
 <vance> That TV was as fun as the TV u show me
 <ian> Is this where trial by combat is introduced?
 <taylor> That was reeeaaal
 <vance> I hope so
 <vance> I want to head butt trump jr
 <vance> He has that look
 <peter> Go to one of the debates and just do it
 <ian> Vance pls
 <taylor> I bet his head is really mushy
 <ian> Like an old pumpkin 
 <michael> this will be the mantra of the next 4 years
 <peter> Lol
 <vance> Grampy:(
 <ian> Lmao I doubt Grampy even watched he was probably too busy watching Americas funniest videos 
 <ian> Love that man 
 <vance> America's grampy
 <vance> That was kinda America's funniest video in a way
 <vance> This is like your grampy if your grampy was a senator in Vermont and humans rights activist 
 <angel> what if trump wins
 <angel> and somehow miraculously he's the best president we've ever had
 <angel> inexplicably
 <vance> Kris signed up for a study abroad program once
 <vance> It was about $7000
 <vance> Which included housing, tuition, and 2 excursions 
 <vance> We can do that but for like 8 semesters
 <angel> 7000s not that bad
 <vance> Yeah for everything it gives it's really cheap
 <ian> Depends where tho right?
 <vance> Try to pay a semester of rent for 7000
 <vance> He was going to Rome I think
 <vance> But he wasn't able to go in the end bc of things at home 
 <ian> I'm surprised it was that cheap
 <vance> Ya me too
 <ian> Especially Rome
 <ian> My aunt did that like 10 years ago and it was $15k+ if I remember correctly 
 <vance> O wow
 <vance> He was doing it with some program out of sbcc
 <ian> Ya I don't remember what college she went to
 <taylor> We should put on a community play
 <taylor> At a park
 <ian> @constitution park 
 <ian> Already a stage 
 <taylor> We could hang posters for ppl to audition and write the worst play
 <taylor> Ya perf maybe some of the homeless will join
 <ian> Should it be a musical? I've always hated musicals 
 <taylor> Ya no just a play
 <taylor> A non linear one that doesnt rly make sense
 <ian> I want it to not make sense so much that people make sense of it and it becomes a well renowned play 
 <angel> The first scene should be a scene from the middle of the play that's just dialogue and not very interesting but essential to the plot
 <taylor> Theres no stage but the actors need to act like there is
 <ian> No stage or no props?
 <ian> Like in order to "sit" in a chair do I squat?
 <taylor> Ya ud need to squat
 <ian> F
 <taylor> But also no stage necessary the dialogue is the real star
 <vance> We should do the same things as bands
 <vance> Throw a party so ppl come
 <vance> And we will just perform in the middle of the party 
 <nina> Guys I just want to let you know that Clover passed away today, please send her your love
 <nina> She had a pen with shade and water outside but the heat must have been too much I can't talk very much right now I'm kind of a mess just so you guys know what happened 
 <vance> Aw I'm sorry
 <vance> She was disadvantaged doggy but was able to live out her days in a loving home 
 <vance> Smelly but good dog
 <vance> But also infamous seat stealer 
 <ian> I'm so sorry. She was loved and will be missed 
 <angel> You gave her a good home for what its worth. 
 <vance> This friday me and Ettore are getting sushi @ 1
 <vance> And does anyone want to play d&d after that?
 <vance> We could make characters in advance 
 <ian> Might not be able to sushi but depending on what time I'll d&d
 <vance> Just sometime after were done sushi 
 <vance> Whenever ppl can meet up I guess
 <michael> Friday is my last work day but I'm down to D&D afterward. If you guys wanna start earlier though no worries, I won't be home til 6ish
 <vance> Kk it's easy to join in
 <vance> Ettore is master story tellu
 <michael> Apparently it's also easy to be slain immediately if you wear only spandex 
 <peter> You need armor 
 <michael> I maintain that one does not need armor if one is slippery 
 <michael> I merely was not slippery enough 
 <vance> I think I'm gonna make a paladin
 <vance> Maybe
 <ian> I think after watching and playing for a bit I get what I have to do now
 <ian> No holding back
 <vance> Last time was kinda dead too its usually better
 <vance> I think we should have wine
 <ian> Ya I just wasn't sure how much I could do/try to do
 <ian> I agree
 <ian> https://twitter.com/robdelaney/status/781154180048252929
 <ian> Also this is important 
 <vance> Pretty much anything you can think of
 <jacob> Someone sell me weed
 <hunter> Don't think I can sell you any but I'll give you some for free with donation 👍
 <jacob> Oh for real? I've always wanted to be a philanthropist.
 <hunter> Haha yeah
 <jacob> Some big dark clouds built up over the hill...
 <nina> Yeah it could rain 
 <jacob> Possible thunder too. Prob. not in cam tho
 <ian> Walked outside and heard a roar but was disappointed with a plane 
 <jacob> Felt a raindrop unless this damn lady palm tree was saving moisture to drop on me
 <taylor> Ill dnd fri 
 <taylor> Mike this pic made me realize how good a nickname administrator is for u
 <hunter> HAHAHAHA
 <michael> holy shit 
 <michael> never forget the "I finally brushed my weird longish hair" bowl cut days 
 <hunter> Dang Vance you see that pax era?
 <hunter> Even smaller than pax 2
 <peter> Pax becoming so discrete.
 <taylor> Breaking news after itching a rare crotch scratch local boy finds ant carcass on penis head 
 <peter> Was it a red ant? 
 <taylor> I dont think so but how can i tell
 <peter> Is it on fire?
 <vance> I saw an ad for it but I haven't checked out the specs yet
 <vance> There's the pax 3 and the pax era I think
 <vance> Era looks like a USB lol
 <hunter> Era looks ideal for discreet pufifn
 <vance> Yeah it really does hahah
 <vance> Can hold it behind my ear like a high tech greaser 
 <taylor> No my dingr lives to die another day
 <taylor> The eras so cheap too
 <ian> Ur dingr is for me to destroy 
 <hunter> How much? I saw a post saying it's only available in Cali and Colorado
 <taylor> The slogan should be say goodbye to ur tolerance
 <taylor> Or wave hello maybe bc then ur getting more tolerance
 <taylor> Its 60
 <hunter> Dang not bad! 
 <taylor> Its weird how expensive ovens for wheat are
 <taylor> Like theyre just high tech lighters 
 <taylor> They get hot n then make sure the vapor gets to ur mouth
 <peter> So the pax era has pods for concentrate and the pax 3 is both herb and concentrate 
 <vance> Yo who's yo to hang
 <ian> I won't be able to until l8r
 <vance> Kkkkkkk
 <vance> I'm free for the rest of the day 
 <vance> Prob gonna eat lunch at home though 
 <vance> My trunk is so dank already
 <ian> Lmk what's gooooood around 6?
 <vance> Dope
 <jacob> Tryna do homework I'll let ya know
 <jacob> also heres something
 <vance> Don't try just do
 <jacob> the fuckin state of online english courses:
 <jacob> "I agree that this is good criticism, you’re very clear in the points you are making and you even cite the pages on what you are talking about! I like that you are very brief with your sentences but they are also very informative and you give a full understanding of what is going on without me even having to read the story. I also like how you conclude with stating that Gregor is just trying to adapt the best that he can in his new lifestyle and an insect because you are re-stating your thesis which is exactly what we are supposed to do"
 <jacob> im dying
 <vance> They're the opposite of what they like about you
 <vance> They use as many words as they can 
 <jacob> these are the people I have to respond to so there is a fair amount of 'trying' involved in this
 <jacob> that wasnt even to me though I just found this response
 <angel> yea that was a thing i hated about my online creative writing class; almost no one actually criticized anything anyone wrote even tho everything everyone wrote was garbage (me included)
 <jacob> Half of the responses are just "I like the way you really did the bare minimum response and could English properly"
 <jacob> Have u started classes wangle?
 <angel> yea
 <angel> taking 4 classes this q
 <jacob> Nice, how is it??
 <jacob> Classes, living, all that
 <vance> Also what classes
 <vance> O
 <angel> its been cool. classes are just starting so we'll see
 <angel> but ppl are nice and i like biking
 <vance> What're your first impressions of your classes?
 <vance> Are they big?
 <angel> im taking mechanics, electromagnetism, clit 30c (literature), and european union
 <angel> yea some classes are big
 <angel> all my professors are super nice tho
 <angel> im taking the first physics course u need to take for the major
 <jacob> European union class??
 <vance> I love clit literature 
 <angel> and the professor is this sweet old man with this accent
 <angel> and he's very nice
 <jacob> Ya +1 for biking though very nice campus and area for that
 <vance> What kind of accent 
 <angel> im not sure
 <angel> i think indian
 <angel> he's like "put in time and u we will make best physicist ok?"
 <angel> yea eu class
 <angel> it covers the history of the eu from 1960-present
 <angel> its inception what it is where its going
 <angel> neat stuff
 <angel> also like why doesn't every city have bike paths like college campuses
 <angel> also I am become increasingly proficient in cooking chicken breat and eggs
 <vance> Just google easy recipes that's what I do lol 
 <vance> Ur prof sounds cute
 <angel> he is
 <vance> I had an old cute middle easter prof for econ 
 <vance> Middle eastern ppl have big ol eyebrows
 <vance> Looks cute when they turn white and bushy 
 <angel> yea its very endearing
 <vance> What's ur favorite thing about SB so far
 <angel> Might be the bike paths or the library.
 <angel> I hadn't used a library as a resource in such a long time and it was really sick to encounter an entire area of space dedicated to vector calculus and other maths
 <angel> Like I was longing for a vector calc book and there was an entire selection of authors to choose from
 <vance> Hahahahahhaha
 <angel> With notes made by other students and stuff and suddenly ur connected to people sharing the same interests and struggles across time. 
 <vance> That sounds very angel 
 <angel> Books are cool
 <vance> Hahah I'm happy for you
 <angel> Also Frankenstein is lit
 <angel> Mary Shelly had the coolest squad
 <vance> Ur so cute wangle hahah
 <angel> O u
 <jacob> >cute
 <jacob> >not respectable and principled gentleman scholar
 <jacob> >collapse of western civilization as we know it
 <jacob> <meme arrowe
 <ian> Hang?
 <jacob> Is there a hang?
 <jacob> I just scrapped my last 4 hours of work on this essay
 <jacob> I chose to analyze and respond to a friggin 20 page article about feminist theory in Kafkas metamorphosis
 <jacob> But then I realized I'm writing an opinion response to an opinion piece that basically was suggesting that Kafka wanted to be a woman and phallic imagery everywhere and female liberation and then random mostly unrelated ideas throughout I actually agreed with what the fuck was that
 <michael> you should take what you wrote 
 <michael> remove any citations 
 <michael> and make your own 20 page article about female liberation 
 <jacob> Well the way the topic was set up
 <jacob> I could literally take things from her article
 <jacob> Say I agreed with then
 <jacob> And then just cite things from the book that vaguely support her theories
 <jacob> And I'm done
 <jacob> But I don't have the guts.
 <jacob> For some reason another topic we can choose (there's a few) is just to read a small biography about him, and respond to a quote of his and argue how it relates to the text. Which is mostly unrelated to the topic of literary theory we've been discussing (and which all the other topics address)
 <jacob> So I think on Saturday or Sunday (it's due Monday) I'll shit out that topic and cry like a baby a little bit. Also she bumped up the due date. I hate school mom, all the teachers are fucking gay as fuck. I don't have any frie
 <vance> Me and ian are hanging 
 <vance> What u guys up to
 <jacob> Working on body posi. Enjoying my natural smells and thanking God
 <jacob> Naw I'm eating
 <ian> We're playing OW
 <vance> Sawp
 <vance> U finna hang

 <vance> Majestic is pretty bad venue 
 <ian> Jk I have cook hoss food
 <ian> To cook
 <michael> yah majestic has terribad sound engineering imo but its close by
 <vance> And just uncomfortable overall
 <vance> A lot of ppl perform there tho
 <vance> And es always cheaper there 
 <taylor> some ideas for community plays tell me which is funner
 <michael> ebook and body pillow 
 <michael> are my votes 
 <vance> I like the eBook 
 <angel> Can they all be separate plots of one larger narrative  that join together and climax greatly
 <angel> I think I like krav maga dad and channing Tatum best tho
 <vance> I like the loosley related overall plot idea with big climax 
 <jacob> The bottom 3 are fantastic
 <jacob> And need to be made
 <jacob> So I guess that makes all of rhem
 <jacob> We'll do them all seasonally
 <taylor> Ya i think channing tatum would be easiest to do for our freshman play
 <taylor> I also wrote a cold open for a diff one but its in my handwriting and rly rough draft
 <taylor> Also i need ideas for diff chars 
 <taylor> We shud have ppl read for all of em without knowing the entire plot
 <peter> If I may extend the offer to do me a favor?
 <peter> Anyone want to help fold and/or throw the Sunday paper with me.
 <vance> Let's marathon pirates of the Caribbean 
 <vance> I haven't seen past 2
 <vance> There's a spell book app for dnd
 <vance> There's an app for everything wow
 <vance> DnD is gonna be better than ever 
 <angel> I discovered a faster bike route to get to my classes
 <angel> I feel like Columbus
 <angel> Minus the genocide and slave trade tho
 <vance> The northwest passage 
 <jacob> U a genius life an adventure
 <hunter> TIL there's a town called 'Weed' right next to Mt. Shasta
 <angel> 'Hey bro where you from?' 'Weed' 'o nice 420!'
 <peter> (fire) 
 <vance> Ok so I know you're all white and Angel
 <vance> But do you think white ppl w/ dreads is cultural appropriation 
 <jacob> Shut the fuck up
 <vance> Ok
 <ian> Why not its just hair
 <vance> The 1 racist in our group
 <vance> Ya I don't think it is 
 <angel> did u hear that guys?
 <angel> jacob just called vance a "gook"
 <vance> Omgggg jaaake
 <vance> What's u thought on dread wang
 <jacob> Speaking English is cultural appreciation Vance pls go
 <angel> I don't know. how integral is the dread to black culture?
 <vance> I do appreciate this culture 
 <ian> Dreads or cornrows? 
 <vance> Idk 
 <vance> Dreads
 <vance> I thought it was just when you don't comb your hair for a long time lol
 <jacob> Dreads are a pirate thing 
 <ian> Dreads are normal for anyone I think
 <jacob> We have a whole pirate day
 <ian> Ya pretty much
 <jacob> It's fucked up
 <angel> i thought it was a hairstyle that u do hair stuff to get
 <angel> in theory two diff people could arrive at such a style independently and then its not really appropriation
 <vance> Jake u used to have long hair have u ever had dreads hahahah
 <michael> ya I mean dreading is just not combing/washing and rolling hair  
 <vance> So ppl crying about it are over sensitive u think?
 <vance> I asked Sedona on twitter
 <vance> She's black 
 <vance> Lol
 <ian> Make a poll about it
 <vance> That's too edgey for me
 <vance> Also I don't trust the opinion of ppl on the twits 
 <ian> Tru
 <vance> Only when it comes to Taylor's fashion do they know anything 
 <ian> Those are my fav
 <angel> o what did sedona say
 <vance> Tay still doesn't have a romper
 <vance> She didn't reply yet 
 <vance> I think like 75% of ppl said tay would look good in a romper 
 <ian> The people need the romper tay
 <ian> It'll show off ur cute butt
 <vance> It's sexy to be leggy
 <jacob> Yo are u assuming she has an answer bc she's black
 <vance> Prob has a diff perspective 
 <vance> U gotta learn to like gooks jakes
 <vance> But also only us gooks can say gooks
 <jacob> 3 second google search suggests dreadlocks are as old as 3600 yrs from Minoan civilization
 <jacob> And also that it's a misconception that ur not supposed to wash ur locks
 <jacob> Aka u guys are racist
 <jacob> racism
 <vance> Guys 
 <vance> Jake just called me a "gook"
 <vance> :(
 <vance> He called me and said "gook" then hung up
 <jacob> I just picked up some carpet bomb from the store, it's to wash away the red cat piss in my house
 <ian> Jake you really have to relax man
 <jacob> I'm steaming rn like dim sum (Vance doesn't eat this he is not Chinese)

 <michael> who's blanket is this 
 <michael> we've had it for a long time, I think since the pillow fort 
 <vance> Ah
 <vance> The pillow fort of '13
 <vance> Is that the year
 <michael> I think it was 14 
 <michael> actually it could have been 13. I'm basing that off the fact that the drugz were from someone I met at Blenders 
 <vance> Yeah I couldn't remember if it was pre or post drugs
 <vance> I was thinking pre
 <vance> I started in 14
 <michael> after further analysis 
 <michael> and based off of this tweet
 <michael> https://mobile.twitter.com/mischlerfichael/status/455537308087746560
 <michael> it was in 2014, within a couple months of said tweet
 <vance> What month was it
 <vance> Too lazy to log in, in the browser 
 <michael> April 
 <vance> Bc ur stupid profile is private
 <vance> I
 <vance> O
 <vance> I guess I did start drugs already 
 <vance> Or that was like exactly then 
 <vance> I can't remember if it was winter or spring 
 <vance> Do you?
 <michael> I wanna say you started over winter break 
 <vance> That's what I think I remember too
 <vance> I think I remember going to the beach the next day and telling Criz about it
 <vance> But I could have just put the 2 memz 2gether 
 <vance> Idk the brain is nuts 
 <jacob> Especially on drugs
 <nina> Hey guys

 <vance> U gots time girl
 <michael> Sry friends 
 <michael> soon I must sleep 
 <michael> ya boys sleep schedule is all sortsa messed up 
 <vance> Then come hang
 <michael> what we could do is FaceTime and then you can put the phone on the game board and I'll be a monster
 <michael> no way I got to fix it 
 <michael> s l e e p y b o y s
 <peter> I am here Vance
 <angel> yo if u had an infinite plane of uniform surface charge its electric field would be the same no matter how far away you are
 <angel> neat fact
 <jacob> do those exist
 <jacob> Can we detect them
 <jacob> dad
 <angel> no
 <jacob> LE THEORETICALLY
 <michael> why 
 <michael> and don't link me the Feynman magnets 
 <angel> its actually easy math
 <jacob> "And I don't wanna talk to a a scientist, y'all mother :-\ kers Lyon and gettin me pissed."
 <angel> u use gauss law which essentially states that if u have an enclosed charge, the electric field due to the charge depends only on the charge enclosed
 <angel> the law itself is of the form integral(EdotdA)=q/e, where dA refers to the infinitesimal normal area vector of the surface enclosure
 <angel> if ur familiar with the dot product ull know that the dot product of two vectors in line with each other is just the product of their magnitudes
 <angel> in this case, with an infinite plane, we can choose a surface that is perpendicular always to the field produced by an infinite plane.
 <angel> all this to say that the integral reduces to EA
 <angel> or 2EA actually
 <angel> and from guass's law
 <angel> 2EA=q/e
 <angel> E=q/2e
 <jacob> But there are no perpendicular fields
 <jacob> #flatuniverse
 <angel> which is constant and does not depend on distance
 <jacob> #wakemeupinside
 <angel> o wait q=oA, where o is the surface charge density
 <angel> the A didn't vanish
 <angel> so E=o/2e
 <jacob> I don't get paid enough for this
 <peter> Dnd tnght
 <vance> Ye
 <vance> Be rdy to kill
 <peter> Hang soon? 
 <peter> I'm on my last job here soon
 <vance> Yes soon

 <jacob> nah he's playing along
 <jacob> he's a smart fellow prob a fan

 <jacob> And ya we're at tays
 <nina> Okay can I join?
 <jacob> Of course
 <nina> Here
 <nina> (door)
 <nina> Someone come let me in pls?
 <vance> The old trucker lady was the one who was spreading the wisdom btw 
 <jacob> Oh my god
 <vance> All I was trying to say was that it was the same thing just told differently 
 <jacob> Thanks Socrates
 <vance> Man u don't even have to know any philosophers to practice philosophy 
 <jacob> Uhh this man is subverting our children. Recommend hemlock
 <vance> lol
 <jacob> I know that dude I was just fucking with you mentioning the others
 <jacob> Listen tho I initially thought you were trying to say that it was a modern recreation of allegory of the cave which is in essence a bit different from the main idea of each which is a realization about ways of life or whatever
 <jacob> Which is literally recurrent in like every black mirror episode
 <vance> In a sense I was 
 <vance> Not to imply that Allegory of the cave was the original or anything 
 <vance> I've never seen any other episode of black mirror
 <vance> But yeah I was just pointing out it was the same theme 
 <jacob> I mean we're both in agreement of the themes lol
 <vance> Yes
 <vance> We seem to get lost in translation every time we open out mouths 
 <vance> Holy shot
 <vance> I just had a notification about Erica binns but only for a split second 
 <vance> It went away 
 <jacob> also finding "the light" in the episode was her finally falling in love with the right black man and apparently being woke but then LATER PHILOSOPY DOES MATTER BECAUSE EXISTENTIALISM AND WHAT IS TRUE KNOWLEDGE
 <jacob> Hehe binns
 <jacob> O ello miss binns ;-)
 <vance> Her bro and grandma trucker showed some hints of being edjamakated
 <vance> I didn't even get to see what the notification was I just saw the name
 <vance> You think Google is eaves dropping and brought it up based on our convo
 <vance> I'm not comfortable with that
 <jacob> Fosho.. But so did the bride and her fiance, they're not completely mindless and misinformed (like the cave men), they've just accepted their poop reality
 <jacob> But it could be argued that stinky video game bro and alcoholic trucker lady aren't so well off either
 <jacob> That is pretty weird tho
 <jacob> I feel like that happens more often than not. Probably conspiracy
 <vance> I think the bride and groom kind of represented the sophites 
 <vance> Like they were aware but they still chose a path of being fake af
 <vance> Arguably similar to the ppl that put Socrates on trial
 <vance> But that's extending away from the actual Allegory 
 <jacob> Or maybe Socrates WAS WRONG
 <jacob> !!!!
 <vance> Yes bad advice from grampy socrates
 <vance> Yeah gamer bro and drinker gramgram have their own "shadows on the wall"
 <vance> Me and Jake got heated about philosophy ish
 <jacob> Silly old man. Your ideas are crazy. Do you accept death? Oh wait for real? Oh lmao that was easy
 <vance> Now we're brawling in the group message 
 <jacob> Having a discussion is not an argument
 <vance> Yeah him choosing death was def weird 
 <vance> We kinda argued earlier 
 <jacob> Sry not necessarily*
 <jacob> Well that was random and from unclear discussion
 <vance> In the sense that no ideas were communicated well and slightly raising volumes of voice
 <vance> And a little twitch in my eye
 <vance> And the anime triangle vein on my temple 
 <jacob> If anything i found it stimulating and was immediately JACKED
 <vance> JACKED OFF DEEP THOUGHT AND SELF AWARENESS BRO
 <vance> Philosobros
 <vance> It'll be like philosophy concepts for dummies 
 <vance> Sickest youtube channel 
 <vance> Also what kind of booze do u guys want over halloween
 <vance> If u guys wanna booze
 <vance> I'm starting to get excited about Halloween 
 <jacob> Like about Halloween or getting drunk around it?
 <vance> Well like for Halloween 
 <vance> But doesn't have to be Halloween 
 <jacob> sht I have no costume idea oh well I'll be an sexy genius man for Halloween.
 <vance> Was thinking the weekend before but we can get trashed whenever 
 <vance> Yeah I have no idea either 
 <jacob> That's a good point, we can literally get trashed whenever.
 <vance> We can have a terrible theme like Christmas again so we don't have to worry about it lol
 <vance> Yeah like we do we need holidays to dictate our bad decisions
 <vance> Stay woke
 <jacob> He'll no were in the prime our lives tjme
 <vance> Ian is going to hang with his gf that weekend bc I guess she's important to him or something idk
 <jacob> Wow yeah I totally respect that haha completely
 <vance> I dont

 <vance> So if you want to drink you should figure that out 
 <torr> I do not have rum but can invite you guys to stay the night
 <vance> I have a lot of oreos though 
 <vance> I also have buttwipes in case you guys realize toilet paper isn't enough to clean ur butthole 
 <torr> Figure it out, then let me know

 <nina> If you guys want to partay on Halloween my dad is out of town and we can use his house
 <nina> No one said if they wanted to or not? Or if we had plans already 
 <vance> If you cut back and both sides itll look normal 
 <vance> I'm down for Halloween stuff but will you guys be free on the weekend?
 <vance> I'm also down for Monday but I wouldn't go hard on Monday 
 <vance> If that's the type of Halloween thing we were aiming for
 <vance> Aka not remember anything afterwards 
 <jacob> I can only go hard early weekend (like Friday) or on Monday bc I have a big exam on Monday
 <jacob> I mean I'd be down tho
 <jacob> Have no other Halloween plans as of yet
 <hunter> Let's all go to red lobster on Friday gang
 <vance> I haven't had a seafood meal in a while 
 <vance> Kev pangs works there hahaha
 <hunter> More than a meal my friend we must have a feast!
 <vance> Omg ur really craving seafood huh hahaha
 <jacob> I am very down
 <hunter> What's not to love 
 <hunter> And them biscuits
 <peter> Biscuits
 <angel> I'm out of cereal. I'm going to starve.
 <ian> Just don't eat ur poop 
 <vance> Intermittent fasting
 <vance> You only need to eat ever 18 hrs
 <torr> If you scratch your scalp a lot it makes little flakes that are like cereal
 <ian> Pls don't do it 
 <torr> Try New Dandy Flakes!(tm) The Ruffest cereal around!
 <vance> High in brotein
 <vance> Let's get good at cooking

 <nina> Okay so

 <peter> There's a pumpkin patch at Peace Lutheran Church. 
 <vance> I think a lot of grocery stores also sell
 <vance> Some pumpkin patches are kinda expensive bc of "pumpkin patch experience"
 <peter> I need some carving tools
 <jacob> The fuck I don't go to no church

 <vance> Pumpkin just a regular plant
 <vance> Mortal
 <vance> A good stabbing is all it takes 
 <michael> dbox is at Muvico, it's like shrek 4D 
 <vance> If u deny Jesus in front of ur peers he will deny you in front of the golden gages 
 <vance> And golden gates
 <michael>  the seat you sit in moves and vibrates with the action 
 <vance> Oh yeah I liked Shrek 4D
 <vance> I'm down 
 <michael> I too am down 
 <vance> Thanks fake jacob 
 <jacob> Sounds dope
 <jacob> But it was a real question
 <jacob> Do we preorder tickets
 <torr> This so called experience enhancer, this dbox is, uh, is supposed to increase your immersion in a film, but on the contrary it acts to separate you from the experience in such a way that you can divorce your mind from your body. This movement allows you to feel the action with your body but forces your mind *sniff* to realize that you are experiencing a fantasy: you are not in the film, you exist outside of the film, and so on. What makes this dbox fascinating to me is we are willing to pay so much for the brief removal from reality *sniff* but then, because we are uncomfortable with our displacement, we pay more in order to remind ourselves that we are real, that we exist outside the film, and so on
 <michael> lmao
 <peter> Who's up? 
 <michael> http://i.imgur.com/6GCrkoH.gifv

 <jacob> K
 <jacob> O hear me, for at last morality did come to me under that coursing water! did cleanse all foolish notions set upon me by You, that servant of Lucifer! who here acted as an enemy of goodness! I will not partake in Your wicked consumption, nor will I submit to idolatry and hedonism when there is yet work to be done. I cast you off, pernicious squanderer, corrupter, malevolent man-serpent. Today is not the Devil's Day where one may easily succumb to his whims, those implanted within him by Lucifer on the day whence he breathe'd the foul air of this Earth. No, that's Monday. Hear me, for I will resume my studies, far removed from such temptations, until I get bored later and try to get that fucking Mercy skin from the Halloween boxes. But yeah I'll hang and drink Monday but I'm gonna take it easy tonight srry I don't feel like doing anything. If u put pants on unzip them and chill and listen to some Groovy Tony my bad

 <michael> guys if you take this class with me you'll get to open this box 
 <michael> haven't you ever wondered what in that box? 
 <torr> No, if JJ Abrams has taught me anything, it's that you should never resolve any mystery and wonder about it and ruminate for your whole life 
 <jacob> Computers will be irrelevant, scrap metal in the coming dark days. Mathematics will be toy for children, like rubiks cube 
 <jacob> Yo anyone want to hang at polling place with stocks and chains?

 <jacob> yeah that thing to raise the farmland and the thing? Well in the fine print IT TURNS YOUR HOUSE INTO A FARM but you voted for it anyway because you THOUGHT IT SOUNDED GOOD and also WERE THINKING ABOUT CHEETO PUFFS FOR DINNER
 <vance> Ok ya that farm thing was confusing

 <vance> O Dolan is winning rn

 <vance> Ur vote could've decided Florida wang
 <vance> U let us down
 <vance> O wait u voted?
 <angel> Yea provisionally
 <vance> What does that mean
 <vance> If Donald Trump wins we just look for who u voted for and that's the winner?
 <angel> It means I wasn't registered to vote here
 <vance> Bc we not gonna accept dat man
 <angel> So they have to write my name down and stuff
 <vance> Ur in the system
 <vance> They gonna see u voted for weed
 <angel> It was all me
 <vance> This whole election was just a trick to catch u dumbass stoners
 <angel> That's how they get the weed fiends
 <angel> Ha got ya just a prank prop!
 <vance> My mom's dumbass Viet friends all voted for trump

 <vance> Viets for real the white trash of asia
 <vance> I'm so sweaty
 <angel> Y would they do that tho
 <vance> Bc hill is a liar
 <vance> (quote)(quote)
 <vance> Until 2008 we were the only Asian group more likely to be Republican 
 <vance> When Vietnamese community members were asked about their stances on refugees they wanted to block them
 <vance> Saying that they r an exception bc they r good refugees 
 <angel> O nice
 <taylor> Looks like the ganj is legal in ca now unless trump wins n death penalizes it
 <vance> Is weed legal is Russia 
 <torr> It's legal in NK
 <taylor> Also fl lmao 
 <taylor> krokodil is cool there so id bet
 <vance> Nice Florida loves weed and trump
 <taylor> They have given themselves wheat only so they could give it back
 <vance> I hope there are crazy riots
 <vance> I am not prepared for my test at all
 <jacob> Look on the bright side
 <jacob> There's gonna be dudes everywhere with acoustic guitars makin songs about this
 <vance> I hope they do a lo of the guitar drumming
 <torr> If everyone just thought the same way as me the world would be a better place
 <ian> It's happening 
 <torr> There's a possibility it's a tie and goes to the house of reps then they vote Trump
 <vance> Not sudden death?
 <torr> That's the sudden death
 <vance> But no real death
 <nina> My mom said she'd marry Glenn (my Canadian roommate) and then sponsor me so I'm good just gonna go to Canada
 <nina> Bye
 <jacob> Canada is pretty conservative in many ways but I guess no bible belt
 <vance> Justing Trudeau is a cutie though 
 <jacob> tbh everywhere sucks (laugh)
 <torr> Also healthcare
 <jacob> tru 
 <torr> I would take "exactly the same as the US except colder and with Universal Healthcare"
 <nina> Yep
 <nina> Cmoooon Michigan 
 <vance> Trump is leading Pennsylvania....
 <nina> Wait wait really I thought it was 48/48
 <vance> Just now
 <vance> Well number wise
 <torr> Only like 8k votes
 <vance> Still scary though
 <vance> That's 20 votes 
 <nina> Yeah if it keeps going the way its going then he will win
 <angel> https://media.giphy.com/media/l49FjqlyEjCEGyJnG/giphy.gif
 <angel> where do you think he's going
 <angel> id like to think hes coming back to us
 <vance> I miss my white grampy
 <jacob> Too bad all the shills went for a crook and not our man bsanders. Never would be had a problem with these so called protest votes
 <jacob> And the sun would actually RISE tommorow
 <angel> winter has come
 <angel> and the long night that never ends
 <vance> Trump is what would happen if Jeffrey never died
 <vance> Joffrey
 <jacob> rip jeffrey
 <angel> too young
 <nina> This sucks
 <nina> I have the worst feeling in my heart
 <vance> Remember when I told you guys about my crazy vivid ww3 dreams
 <vance> I'm sorry none of you guys made it in my dream
 <vance> You guys have seriously been great friends I love you 
 <vance> I on the other hand will be a war hero
 <angel> I love u 2 bb
 <angel> also I've already sacrificed enough for my country to not serve
 <angel> i missed free pizza to provisionally vote
 <jacob> I can't wait to curb stomp and mow down all these fuckin fascists man
 <torr> B A S H  T H E  F A S H
 <ian> Can't stump the trump 
 <torr> You guys probably know better than me
 <torr> What weed companies should I invest in tomorrow morning?
 <vance> Weedmaps
 <vance> They sponsor gamez
 <torr> CANA
 <torr> ?
 <torr> Oh it's CANN now
 <vance> But the stock markets rip
 <vance> Oh wait
 <vance> Invest when it's low
 <torr> Everything goes low so buy buy buy
 <hunter> We now have legal weed folks 
 <angel> What if it was all an act and trump isn't an openly racist, bigoted, habitual liar and is actually a political genius who's spent his whole life secretly planning for this election so that he can reform government from the inside.
 <angel> If only that were true
 <angel> /this is our brexit I suppose
 <angel> On the other hand if trump can into presidency all is possible. 
 <angel> Any neat riots in ur guys' neck of the woods
 <angel> Ppl r rioting in iv
 <angel> Protesting rather
 <jacob> All quiet on the eastern front
 <jacob> I dunno if there's anywhere to get attention in Camarillo
 <jacob> Everyone is like asleep
 <jacob> I watched video of protests at UCSC too
 <angel> Yea makes sense, college campus would be very anti trump
 <nina> White w/o college degree 67%, highschool or less 51%
 <nina> Voted for Trump 
 <nina> It all makes sense
 <michael> I slept through it 
 <michael> Oh god 
 <michael> what have I woken up to 
 <peter> (welcome) to the (new)(world)(order)
 <michael> Tor, look into NASDAQ:GWPH 
 <michael> and maybe INSY, although they haven't been doing so hot because of fentanyl marketing investigation 
 <torr> Kkkk
 <torr> All these protests. The people denouncing them as "riots" show how privileged all the trump grumps are that they don't energy know what a riot looks like
 <ian> (wow)
 <torr> HRC is actually ahead in popular vote by current count by 170K
 <torr> rn
 <torr> But trump with 60 more electoral votes
 <torr> "Democracy"
 <ian> I think almost 1 million people put in "other" candidates
 <torr> 800k
 <ian> Oh nice only went up 100k
 <torr> Doesn't matter because they weren't in swing states
 <torr> All the "other" voters in swing states voted libertarian and those would have been GOP voters otherwise 
 <ian> Bunch of butts
 <vance> Is the electoral college beneficial in any way?
 <ian> They're the pros, bro. The almighty man, man
 <vance> What if someone crazy runs for pres
 <vance> The electoral college will prevent them from winning
 <michael> apparently not amirite 
 <torr> The original purpose supposedly was so that each state could just send a few people to one place to make it easier
 <torr> But at this point it just gives rural white hicks who own tons of land in the Midwest and south more power than urban groups that make up a higher percentage of the population
 <vance> Ooo I see
 <vance> So no
 <vance> This is so sad
 <ian> I remember Mr. Quinn told me I was dumb for thinking the electoral college had too much power 
 <ian> Who's dumb now 
 <vance> Fuck u Mr Quinn 
 <vance> Who's name starts with a Q anyway 
 <vance> More like Mr Quack bc duck him
 <ian> He also told everyone to vote for Marco Rubio bc he was most likely to win 
 <ian> Dingus
 <vance> Wait wtf
 <vance> What kind of educator is telling ppl to vote for a specific candidate 
 <vance> Is he at MC?
 <ian> A dumb one
 <ian> We wrote anon letters to him at the end of the year so we can tell him what we thought of his class so I tore him apart 
 <ian> No cam
 <vance> Wtf
 <vance> I think he can get fired or disaplined for that lol
 <vance> Public school teachers aren't allowed to share things like that
 <ian> He was very outspoken about his political views lol
 <vance> Check out these kids who are super impressionable and don't know anything yet
 <vance> Let me plant my world views into them
 <michael> stock market is actually on the uptick 
 <vance> A net gain?
 <vance> Since yesterday?
 <michael> yup 
 <ian> I've been working, haven't caught up since 12 last night 
 <ian> How low did that baby go?
 <vance> Maybe everyone did try buying when it was low
 <vance> Idk how the stock market works lol
 <michael> mostly on magic and tears
 <ian> Grampy won 
 <ian> Do you guys think this will actually fall through? How long will his presidency go for? 
 <vance> He won't get a second term 
 <vance> No way
 <ian> Attempts to impeach? I'm only thinking of all of the possibilities 
 <vance> I kinda rather not
 <vance> I'm kinda more scared of Mike Pence than him lol
 <vance> Just a feeling though 
 <michael> hopefully now that he's won he won't be a demagogue and his rhetoric will calm down 
 <vance> Hopefully he turns into Barrack 
 <ian> Just a show to please those white boys 
 <ian> Lmao sheds his skin turns into obaman
 <michael> one first thing he said in his victory speech was that we were indebted to Hillary for her long service  
 <michael> so he maybe won't follow through with the special prosecutor stuff 
 <michael> i hope he drops the wall, the immigration stuff, and his goal to get out of the Paris climate change accords in first 100 days 
 <ian> Pull through Donald 
 <michael> apparently getting out of  the climate change stuff isn't actually realistic in 100 days anyways because it's been made into law but regardless pls give us science now Dolan 
 <vance> But with the house and Senate Republican...
 <vance> They can do all their backwards Republican shit 
 <ian> If he wants 
 <michael> Just don't touch the Paris deal  
 <michael> pls no Chinese hoaxarino
 <ian> Man it's 10am in November and I'm sweating bullets
 <ian> It's 84
 <vance> Flog gnaw is a gonna be a riot man
 <vance> I'm gonna buy brass knuckles for real 
 <ian> Do it 
 <peter> The Republicans have the house and Congress also. They are going to have a field term 
 <nina> Maybe if he gets charged for rape we can impeach him?
 <nina> Can't believe I can even say that 
 <michael> https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=how%20to%20impeach%20a%20president
 <nina> I think we could then bc he would have a felony and that's not allowed right?
 <michael> well as I understand it impeachment and conviction are two separate things 
 <ian> He would have to be convicted first which could take God knows how long. Then they would have to attempt impeachment after the conviction, if convicted. Judicial system baby
 <ian> At least I think that's right 
 <jacob> I don't think a felon can be pres so it might be automatic
 <jacob> Maybe me wrong
 <jacob> Also read this maybe
 <jacob> https://theintercept.com/2016/11/09/democrats-trump-and-the-ongoing-dangerous-refusal-to-learn-the-lesson-of-brexit/
 <jacob> Especially u taylor
 <michael> https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2841306
 <michael> some UofUtah law prof wrote this 
 <michael> basically about how trump has engaged in fraud and racketeering already which falls under "high crimes and misdemeanors"  for impeachment 
 <michael> interesting to read about but I don't think it's likely trump will be impeached 
 <michael> I feel weird typing that 
 <nina> I'm so sad ugh
 <nina> My trans cousin has been crying all night 
 <jacob> It ain't the end honey
 <torr> The president is above the law actually
 <torr> Even if he breaks it the House HAS to vote to impeach
 <torr> Like police and stuff can't do anything
 <torr> And then he has to be tried by the senate
 <michael> right, the house and senate being republican dominated will not aid in an impeachment 
 <torr> It's legally possible for the president to walk out onto the street and start shooting people and not get in trouble
 <torr> CALEXIT or naw?
 <michael> yes please 
 <michael> let's get some high powered machinery going along the San Andreas fault 
 <torr> All we need is desalination plants
 <michael> let us flee to the ocean 
 <michael> physically and spiritually 
 <michael> and politically 
 <ian> Haha into the Pacific we go 
 <torr> That's why they don't build them, because they know we need out of state water
 <torr> We have one of the country's largest oil fields directly under LA
 <torr> I don't expect it to actually happen
 <torr> But then I didn't expect Dolan to be prez
 <michael> thanks for the article Jacob, interesting read 
 <ian> Was written well
 <michael> WOOO TIME TO HOP THAT WEED TRAIN BOYS 
 <michael> ALL I SEE IS GR (money) N
 <jacob> fuk I'm at school no time to invest
 <michael> TRAINS LEAVING NOW BETTER HURRY 
 <jacob> I won't be home till like  rip money!
 <michael> TRAINS LEAVING NOW 
 <michael> BETTER HURRY 
 <michael> CHOO CHOO 
 <michael> it's a dangerous game. inb4 90% of pump and dump weed stocks are owned by the SEC 
 <ian> Stocks are way too risky 4 me unless I hired some pro to do it for me
 <michael> hire me 
 <michael> I'll blow 100% of your money in 10% of the time 
 <michael> now that's value 
 <michael> if you can't understand those numbers don't worry I'll do the understanding for you 
 <torr> Dang I only managed to blow 20% of my money
 <ian> Can you use your money for me? You know like a loan 
 <michael> Sure, your interest will be .05% compounded hourly 
 <michael> .05% is a low number 
 <michael> you're practically making money from this loan!! 
 <torr> "Avocado prices expected to drop! (sell) (sell) (sell)"
 <ian> I think ur mom was driving behind me Tay
 <ian> It was crazy dude
 <taylor> Dang did she honk at u
 <ian> I don't think she even knew lol
 <michael>  how is everyone's post election depression doing 
 <torr> I'm excited to see the liberal tears in my English class today
 <jacob> There were quite a few upset ones in my US history
 <jacob> the imwithher kinds and they were pretty outspoken
 <jacob> Then a lot of people with moderate level headed views, surprisingly
 <torr> I'm sure my prof will be very outspoken
 <jacob> And there was one jittery meathead in front of me with a trump lanyard who was either muttering some things at other's comments and smirking or looking rly pissed at their comments and getting angry. But when it came to discuss actual history he was looking at his fantasy football league the whole time
 <peter> You know what Michael, I think I'm alright. 
 <peter> Thanks for asking. 
 <michael> Good to hear it Pete
 <michael> lol I love my dad
 <jacob> Ahh
 <jacob> Dad
 <peter> On the newspaper today, it says "It's Trump"
 <ian> How did it feel looking at that over and over 
 <peter> I fold the papers upside down.
 <peter> Plus there was a wrap
 <peter> So still (idc)
 <ian> Did you sleep?
 <peter> How are all my fellow Americans and Vance doing? 
 <torr> Is it not ironic how all the media said Bernie appealed only to white voters
 <ian> Is racism okay now?
 <torr> Then HRC lost because of the white voters
 <jacob> Finally I can be comfortable in my own skin, as a racist
 <jacob> I mean, in my country. I always felt very, very comfortable with my skin
 <angel> We race war now?
 <angel> It was interesting talking about he's feelings about results in my eu class
 <torr> I'm so damn excited but class doesn't start until 5
 <angel> Start a riot until then
 <angel> And then a revolution
 <torr> That's what I've been saying
 <angel> I expect Ecorp on its knees by tomorrow morning. 
 <peter>  I'd follow you Angel
 <vance> What kind of work do you guys wanna do for our army during the civil war?
 <jacob> Intelligence analyst
 <jacob> "Reporting in, our enemies are dumber than us"
 <torr> Propaganda artist
 <torr> Also she has a boyfriend
 <torr> Update on Tory's romantic life
 <vance> She only has room for one man in her life
 <vance> And his name is Jesus Christ 
 <vance> Fuck off ettore
 <michael> damn 
 <torr> Why can't everyone just be polyamorous?
 <vance> Bc I'm uncomfortable crossing swords 
 <angel> That's unfortunate tor
 <angel> Also wow Vance homophobic much. This country is falling apart before our very eyes. 
 <vance> I only like to brag about having them in my trunk
 <torr> You don't even need to do that
 <vance> I just felt like it'd be an important step in a relationship with my other lover
 <vance> Honoring his love like I'm knighting him
 <peter> Vance, are you excited for floggnaw?
 <ian> (welcome)
 <angel> oh it reads la lol. that took me too long to interpret
 <vance> I'm very excited 
 <vance> Leaving Friday night and spending all weekend in LA
 <ian> Who you going with?
 <vance> Criz Sonam and Mauricio 
 <vance> I think u met Criz 
 <ian> O nice yeah I know them all
 <ian> Sounds rowdy
 <ian> (party)
 <vance> Oh yeah soccer
 <vance> I'm assuming lol
 <ian> Yes yes 
 <peter> Do you have a schedule of who you are going to see perform?
 <vance> We'll probably get make it on Friday when they get back 
 <vance> I think Criz was trying to decide between the internet and ferg
 <michael> anyone brunch? I'll be in cam in 30
 <ian> (dog)
 <ian> Sorry boyo
 <nina> Ian I got you a shot glass from AK to add to the collection 
 <ian> (drink)
 <nina> Don't let me forget to give it to ya, it's currently at Hunters 
 <nina> On yeah and I also got this cool fun smoking dice game
 <nina> Where we roll four die that dictate who and how we smoke
 <nina> So next hang we all gotta play 
 <nina> (play)
 <vance> Can't tell if protestors or car accident 
 <vance> 101n stoppef
 <ian> Scope it out
 <ian> Full investigation
 <vance> If I ever get to it
 <ian> I was working at an old people's home and I noticed the time the person signed in with before me was like 2 hours ahead which I thought was weird. Then when I went to the back the sensor for the gate was blocked with a piece of paper so it would stay open
 <ian> I call foul play 
 <vance> Got off central
 <torr> It is a rolled semi
 <torr> I saw it this morning at like 8
 <torr> Held me up for 90 mins
 <ian> Man that semi was really protesting 
 <vance> Oh jeeze
 <vance> Ya I took central
 <vance> Just parked 
 <vance> Took me 50mins to get here
 <peter> Probably protesters I can't remember if I saw the news or if it was a dream of people going on to the 101
 <peter> Semi protesters.
 <angel> Exciting time in the world right now. 
 <vance> It was actually Optimus Prime
 <vance> He isn't happy with the election results 
 <ian> It's fun going into blenders every couple of months to see the condition 
 <ian> Gradually it's turned into all girls 
 <vance> Ettore did you go to the rally at VC?
 <nina> It's ever changing 
 <vance> What a dynamic work space lol
 <vance> The ice cream shop had the same employees for 3 yrs straight
 <jacob> Wtf
 <jacob> There's a class I need for UCSB that isn't being taught next semester
 <jacob> Hhguuiiigiuehuiei
 <jacob> I guess I have to take it there? They aren't gonna BAN me right?
 <jacob> OK I'm chill I forgot they aren't requirements just recommended
 <vance> U chill 
 <angel> O r u tagging ucsb j?
 <michael> if you have requirement not in vcccd you can look at pierce college 
 <michael> I might have to take data structures and algorithms there 
 <jacob> Yeah wangle
 <jacob> Well I finished IGETC
 <angel> o nice that's super helpful
 <angel> r u history major?
 <jacob> Yea. There's 2 sections I need to finish, one I can finish next semester but there's only 2 classes I haven't taken that articulate in the other section and neither are there spring 2017
 <jacob> I'll check VC/OC online too
 <jacob> and yis history boy
 <angel> Nice. Yea that sounds like a good idea to check at other colleges near you
 <angel> on the other hand it might be nice to take them at ucsb for added rigor, at least depending on how comprehensive u feel courses are at moorpark, but that's also extra money
 <jacob> tru tru
 <jacob> I'd probably go for money/time saving. We shall see
 <nina> Yo check out Childish Gambino's new song
 <nina> Way more like singing versus raps
 <nina> I enjoyed it
 <peter> Me and your mama 
 <peter> (me) (&) (you) (mom)
 <peter> I saved it on spotify earlier but haven't listened to it yet. 
 <nina> It's pretty different but good
 <jacob> How u fokks
 <jacob> F o l k s
 <peter> Good, kind of drained
 <peter> How are you senpai?
 <nina> Good, pretty tired also 
 <jacob> I'm good too. About to gorge on some taco bell. Ohlawdforgiveme
 <nina> Oh that sounds dank
 <peter> Did you get cinnabon delights?
 <jacob> Naw I didnt
 <jacob> Dorito gordita crunch thing is so good omg
 <vance> Oh ya Jake I found ur cigs in my car
 <vance> I haven't looked in my back seats since Halloween apparently they are just sitting on the seat
 <torr> Guys want to play D&D tomorrow or is everyone over it? 
 <vance> I'm going to flog gnaw tmrw 
 <jacob> Oh nice
 <peter> I'm ready to DnD when everyone is.
 <peter> Vance lose yourself. 
 <vance> Kk I think k by the following Wednesday there will be a missing persons report 
 <vance> Don't come looking for me
 <angel> have fun. don't die
 <vance> Don't tell me how to live my life
 <angel> YOU'RE NOT MY MOM
 <angel> hey group question. imagine u have an assembly of charges. Say the group of charges is arranged so that each is the corner of a cube. if u place a charge at the center, where it would be equidistant to each charge, (you would imagine since the distances are the same and the charges are the same it wouldn't experience a net force due to symmetry; you can consider this would happen for any symmetrical charge distribution) does the charge placed in the center move? imagine no gravity. also cows are only spherical.
 <michael> Yes
 <angel> how? no google pls
 <michael> trivial
 <angel> who are u my textbook
 <michael> it will be left as an exercise to the reader due to its triviality 
 <angel> i think it's good of textbooks to do this, but its painful. it must be painful tho
 <vance> Ok so 8 charges spread to all the corners
 <vance> And 1 in the dead center of (cube)
 <angel> yea
 <vance> What is being asked
 <vance> Lmao
 <angel> does the charge at the center move
 <vance> With my minimal knowledge and basic logic I think no
 <vance> But since you asked
 <vance> It must be yes
 <angel> that's good intuition
 <vance> If it made sense you wouldnt be excited enough to ask us
 <angel> it would make sense that it doesn't move
 <angel> but it do
 <vance> U only like things that don't make sense
 <vance> I know my angel more than I know my physics
 <vance> Why does it move?
 <michael> the intuitive parts of physics are often quite intuitive 
 <michael> thusly 
 <angel> i don't know
 <michael> Additionally, how can it die? 
 <angel> im trying to figure it out
 <vance> Lmao
 <angel> i was hoping someone might have insight
 <vance> If it can never rest how can it die
 <angel> if u really want to know u can look up earnshaw's theorem
 <vance> Trump doesn't make sense
 <vance> Maybe he will be good pres
 <angel> he could actually do some real damage tho, im starting to realize
 <vance> Like what 
 <angel> it might be a good time to a good politically active citizen
 <vance> Earths economy 
 <angel> paris agreement thing
 <vance> And actual earth
 <angel> he doesn't believe in global warming
 <vance> Climate change is good bc we humans thrive in warmer weather 
 <vance> Snow is crazy it makes our cars slide around
 <vance> Very bad
 <vance> Warm good
 <angel> u make a good point
 <vance> Me smart
 <vance> Me know best
 <angel> on the other hand he's pushing eu to develop more self dependency. although that could be good or bad depending on how much u like eu
 <vance> Eu
 <vance> More like ew
 <vance> This man seems to be faulty in almost every way I look
 <vance> With so many people supporting him I feel like I must be really blind in some way
 <vance> Even with me trying to keep my mind as open as I can can't seem to grasp anything good about him
 <angel> well cal and where we live isn't really heavy on trump support I feel
 <vance> Yeah I get that
 <vance> But I don't get what's there to support 
 <angel> a lot of people voted for him probably due to racial reasons and because he was the only antiestablishment candidate
 <michael> I think motivational reasoning is at the heart of it 
 <michael> motivated* er
 <angel> ppl don't like the way things are and they think since trump isn't a politician he'll change things
 <angel> or they don't think he'll be a good president and wreck the status quo
 <angel> or they think Hillary was worse
 <angel> or they were real mad at the dnc
 <michael> people seek out information that confirms what they already believe 
 <angel> yea that too
 <vance> Yeah mine and Ettore's conversation brought up the same points
 <angel> at least these are some reasons why i think ppl voted for hik
 <vance> Those may be some pros
 <vance> But I can't see how they could outweigh the cons
 <vance> Many of the issues aren't really abstract 
 <vance> Like to be against climate change and deny the science 
 <angel> ppl might not be thinking that long term or be unaware
 <vance> But what makes the scientist qualified anyway
 <vance> I can't believe ur just making up all this physics wang
 <angel> bunch of science bitches telling me what to do
 <vance> Ur doing it for China aren't you
 <vance> Chynah
 <angel> 他們給我很好
 <michael> "science takes a similar amount of faith as religion, you're just trusting all of these scientists that their research is valid" - person i worked with at blenders 
 <vance> I knew ur profile pic looked real chinese
 <vance> In person it's a little weord
 <michael> also believed dinosaurs weren't real 
 <vance> But in that pic it's so easy to tell
 <angel> o nice
 <michael> ERRORS IN THE FOSSIL RECORD 
 <vance> I didn't know that Mike 
 <vance> Wow it's like purposely ruining your childhood for ur agenda
 <angel> but yea too many people feel that way
 <vance> Why would you ever claim they weren't real even if it were true
 <angel> think scientists are part of the elite telling them what to do
 <vance> I can imagine how science can seem really abstract to ppl not exposed to it
 <angel> yea it might me they're just not exposed to it
 <angel> https://youtu.be/baCwRZ7Fbvc?t=82
 <angel> similar scenario during brexit
 <angel> essentially a lot of economists, both for and against brexit, released reports saying that brexit's going to hurt uk's economy
 <angel> the guy for brexit just says they always say that and they're being paid to do so
 <vance> Oman
 <vance> Brexit
 <vance> Such a fitting ugly name for an ugly thing lol
 <vance> That's true
 <vance> Man this is what I get for making so many brexit jokes 
 <angel> it was a pretty bad move but the people were upset
 <angel> and they didn't like immigrants
 <angel> http://www.europarl.europa.eu/the-president/en/press-room/schulz-on-the-result-of-the-us-presidential-elections
 <angel> ill post this here because I thought it'd be interesting to here what leaders outside of us think about the results
 <angel> http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-16-3640_en.htm?locale=en
 <angel> the first link is the president of eu parliament and the second is the response of the presidents of the eu council and commission
 <vance> I feel like it must be way harder to be an immigrant in other places
 <vance> It's harder to say other countries foundation was built by immigrants 
 <angel> yea that's true
 <vance> I'm glad the people we expect to be professional and civil are doing just that
 <vance> 2 crazy ppl is def worse than 1
 <vance> Good job EU 
 <angel> i shouldn't generalize and say that 'they' didn't like immigrants but it was one among other reasons for voting to leave the eu
 <angel> yea
 <vance> It was also pretty much 50/50 vote like here
 <angel> yea uk's pretty divided too
 <vance> I hope the US doesn't follow suit with the rise in hate crimes
 <angel> also a big surprise
 <vance> But that's already been on the rise since the start of the election process 
 <angel> the guy who proposed the brexit referendum did it because he didn't think it would actually pass
 <vance> I'm sure trump didn't think he'd win but either 
 <angel> he put it on his platform to appeal to growing anti-eu sentiment
 <vance> Stupid people messing with important things 
 <angel> at the same time some of the responsibility might lie on the public/the issue might be indicative of an underlying problem
 <angel> i don't know im spitballing
 <angel> also anyone come up with an answer for the charge problem
 <angel> ?
 <angel> I'm thinking it might be that forces are still exerted on the charges at the corners
 <angel> and all tho they might be fixed they're stilling experiencing an electric force
 <angel> meaning a changing voltage in the region
 <angel> idk someone come up with anything?
 <angel> o i think i got it
 <vance> Does spinning count as moving
 <vance> Or moving from that spot?
 <angel> this wasn't exactly intuitive
 <vance> Would it even spin
 <vance> Idk
 <angel> i feel like i cheated u since u needed more tools to solve the problem than i gave u
 <vance> Wow wang I'm insulted 
 <vance> You think Seidel didn't give me everything I needed to answer that
 <vance> Screw you
 <vance> Real physics snob you know that
 <angel> ur right seidel taught u better
 <michael> I read on the wiki that earnshaws doesn't apply to moving ferromagnets
 <michael> including the Levitron 
 <michael> so no to spinning? 
 <michael> maybe I misunderstand 
 <vance> Is that autobot or deception 
 <vance> Levitron
 <michael> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levitron
 <michael> but dude it's called the Levitron 
 <vance> Oh I was kinda close
 <vance> It is a toy lol
 <angel> im not sure about the spinning part
 <angel> but i think its because no motion would imply zero net electric force at the center
 <angel> which would mean a local maximum for the voltage, which laplaces equations tell us can only happen at the boundaries
 <angel> ie never inside the box
 <angel> also mike yea that's a cool name
 <angel> fk my 5th grade teacher had us play with those for a project and we were supposed to get it to levitate by spinning it by hand.
 <vance> Would it be simultaneously be moving in all directions
 <angel> i got it to work once and never figured out how it worked
 <angel> i don't know but i know it moves
 <vance> Omg wang we knew that from the beginning 
 <vance> U already told us
 <angel> yea ur right what a dum question
 <vance> I hate you
 <vance> Figure it out and report back 
 <angel> itll go one way and then like the other way or something
 <vance> UgHHgg
 <michael> Invest in FNMA
 <michael> Vance as my CPA
 <vance> Send me their portfolio 
 <michael> is it a good idea for me to take out a mortgage 
 <vance> Debits and credits 
 <michael> and invest it in one stock 
 <vance> I got some serious points deducted from my test
 <vance> I had to take 90 days interest on a note payable
 <vance> And I have to date the journal
 <vance> But I got the number of days between June and July mixed up
 <vance> So everything is 1 day off
 <michael> I have done my due diligence
 <michael> and I believe that I should sacrifice my diversified portfolio
 <michael> and invest my entire net worth
 <vance> No take out a mortgage and put it all into slots
 <michael> in this one stock
 <michael> thoughts
 <michael> I would like to bet my parents house on this stock
 <michael> https://www.google.com/finance?q=OTCMKTS:FNMA

 <vance> You can mortgage my parents house too
 <vance> And sell my weed to highschoolers if that's not enough
 <michael> I called Fidelity 
 <michael> surprisingly I almost immediately got a representative 
 <michael> and I am now enrolled in extended hours trading 
 <michael> I will make the trade at 4 AM
 <vance> There are some seriously by spiderman my house
 <vance> Spiders
 <vance> Not spiderman 
 <vance> Invest in extermination related businesses 
 <vance> Big spiders*
 <michael> I'm afraid I can't take on that much risk right now

 <michael> can you read through that for me
 <michael> and make sure that checks out
 <vance> Um
 <vance> The answer is yes
 <michael> great
 <michael> do u have any capital u'd like to supply
 <michael> as my CPA that is your duty no?

 <vance> We just got it thooOOoOuuGhh
 <vance> What process does he have to go through to get rid of it
 <vance> Can he use executive order for that?
 <michael> so its already been ratified into international law, and if you read article 28 (http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf) it basically says that any time 3 years after it has "entered force for a party" the party can withdraw, and that withdrawal takes effect upon expiry of one year, making the earliest date for withdrawal november 2020 i believe. now a republican house and senate could pass a law to immedietly pull out, but i dunno if that will happen. I think that's right, am I missing anything?
 <vance> 100% of Republicans can't be climate deniers right?
 <vance> They have majority but it's pretty close down the middle
 <vance> I have no idea about the process
 <michael> vance you should know, the money i made selling the chemicals that make up your body are going to good use
 <michael> FNMA shot up to 3 from 2.5 a share this morning
 <vance> Well did you invest me?
 <torr> You guys should remember that the US ignore international law all the time
 <vance> Trump's a doer
 <vance> He doesn't care
 <michael> true, and UN can't do jack about it 
 <vance> He gets things done
 <michael> """""""""sanctions"""""""
 <michael> also Vance I did 
 <nina> Ugh guys it's not even 10am why are we talking about this 
 <vance> If we don't buy now, the stocks will keep going up
 <ian> Technically local cities and states can do their own regulations for carbon emissions and energy now so potentially it's kind of okay
 <vance> We will miss out
 <michael> I bought 1000 shares at market open this morning 
 <vance> Amazing 
 <michael> before the dip I was up 500 already
 <michael> I think we're going to the moon 
 <vance> Ive never been more glad to be your asset
 <michael> but rly if I invest on Wednesday I would be up 2.5K 
 <vance> Are you really investing?
 <michael> where was your body when I needed it 
 <vance> Do you have investments?
 <vance> On Wednesday I was failing some test
 <vance> So my worth actually dropped
 <michael> yus I literally called fidelity at 2 am to enroll in after hours trading 
 <vance> lol
 <vance> If we were a year older
 <vance> And invested in Sysco when we were 18
 <vance> That's the company that won the kid the stock market game 
 <michael> then realized after staying up til 4 am it wasn't a security I could buy at the time so I made a limit order set to buy when the market opened and went to sleep 
 <vance> Did you really sleep though 
 <vance> I don't believe it
 <michael> that's why I'm awake right now, I woke up and checked and saw how much it rose in this little amount of time 
 <michael> and now I can't sleep again lol 
 <vance> Do you have a mutual fund?
 <michael> vanguard 
 <vance> If you have the money it might not be a bad idea
 <vance> Onice
 <michael> yah it's only been recently when I've been learning about derivatives and stuff
 <ian> Read those numbers Mike 
 <vance> I know almost zero about stocks and that kind of stuff
 <vance> But 20 is still really early to invest in mutual funds a good head start 
 <ian> Econ senior year we did fake stocks and I ended up making a good amount of money lol
 <ian> Wouldn't do it again after going through the process 
 <ian> Unless I had Mike do it 
 <torr> I did that and just got dumped everything in netflix and won
 <torr> Or maybe I got second because Sean Knight dumped everything in Peruvian copper futures
 <vance> Did tay end up being like negative 30k hahahah
 <vance> Bc he invested in beggin bites
 <vance> Or whatever that dog treat is
 <michael> trying to just stick with mutual funds and individual stocks 
 <michael> options are really tempting now that I know kind of how they work 
 <michael>  anyone wanna get brunch 
 <torr> I could go for bruncies
 <vance> Fuck Mike I was about to go to the gtm
 <torr> I don't know what bruncies are 
 <vance> Down for brunchies

 <vance> Its insane here
 <peter> Get turnt
 <torr> Drink lots of water bb (loveyou)
 <vance> Ya Pepe v clear 
 <vance> Too much water 
 <peter> Too much water ain't enough water. 
 <peter> Who did you see yesterday Vance
 <peter> Who are you going to see today?
 <vance> Yesterday: tuna, Alina baraz, kamasi Washington, the internet, chance, asap rocky Tyler the creator (he also brought out the fuck Donald Trump guy), and lil wayne
 <vance> Yuna not tuna
 <vance> I thought I missed during asap ferg it was asap rocky lmao
 <vance> Today idk I'm gonna take it easier I'm tired man
 <vance> We gonna see school boy q, ertkah bag, Anderson paak, and flat bush though
 <vance> I'm a lil Wayne fan now lol
 <vance> I'll tell u guys about it later tho
 <vance> Acid is nutd
 <vance> I dosed 25ug twiced
 <vance> Peaked during kamasi Washington and chance 
 <vance> Kamasi Washington is also really nuts 
 <vance> I've only listened to him a little before
 <ian> I'm glad you're enjoying yourself boyo
 <vance> I'm think I'm gonna miss at flat bush
 <vance> Mosh
 <peter> Do it
 <peter> Do a flip
 <peter> Flatbush is bad ass.
 <peter> If you're with Lucy they are as well.
 <torr> What are, like, symbols of California?
 <vance> Like buzz feed symbols
 <vance> Like in n out
 <vance> Shaka chill beaches
 <vance> Hollywood 
 <torr> Also do you think the red and white on the flag are good or are the state colors blue and gold better?
 <torr> Making flag mock ups for #calexit
 <vance> I feel like I see blue and gold more bc uc system
 <torr> Blue and gold are the official state colors rn, but the current flag is white with a red star and strip
 <vance> I thought it was with a bear
 <torr> Well yeah the bear is in the middle but there's a red star and a red strip across the bottom
 <vance> O
 <vance> Shows how little I look at it flag lol
 <torr> You'll see the new one flying over every house soon #calexit
 <vance> If we exit who will rule us?
 <ian> Jerry Brown?
 <jacob> The governator will return for his rightful throne
 <torr> I nominate Corey
 <angel> but tor the country needs us. we can't leave them alone with trump
 <ian> I think we can be selfish just this once 
 <jacob> that is an amazing pic
 <peter> He is one with the ferris. 
 <nina>  (zen)
 <jacob> big'ol moon
 <michael> When we make em we should replace the yellow with gold foil 
 <torr> How about the bear in the top left?
 <ian> I like this
 <torr> It's supposed to be like the ocean then the beach on the left
 <torr> I wasn't sure whether the bigger or smaller bear looked better
 <ian> Put a marijuana leaf in the blue 
 <torr> http://i.imgur.com/PTylumi.jpg
 <torr> http://i.imgur.com/PTyIumi.jpg
 <torr> "Bigger collection here http://imgur.com/a/dRH9U"
 <peter> Vance is dancing in the pale moonlight
 <ian> South Coast Bear is sweet 
 <ian> Beach with Bear also
 <ian> And bear in beach with star in sun is really good too
 <ian> That's the one
 <torr> The idea is that the blue on the left is like the ocean and then the yellow is the coast
 <ian> It's beautiful Torr so so beautiful. You know what else would be beautiful? A wall. A big, big wall. When I say big folks I really mean it I really really do. Just hUge. 
 <angel> I don't want a wall but why don't we build ridiculous mega structures any more. I want a colossus of rhodes part 2 connecting the great lakes or something
 <angel> hUge
 <ian> That would be a sweet road trip 
 <torr> Too late
 <ian> Righteous
 <torr> The wall represents the wall along the southern border and the weed represents the weed
 <angel> can we get one that's just a zoom in of prime arnie's biceps?
 <angel> also i think tony hawk should be cal pres
 <torr> Left or right?
 <angel> yea
 <angel> a truly sovereign nation
 <ian> Tony Hawk should be doing a kick flip on his bicep 
 <ian> Now that's American 
 <ian> How's everyone's Trumpression today? 
 <ian> I think I may trademark that
 <torr> Made new red and white flags http://imgur.com/a/dRH9U
 <ian> Traditional bottom star is probably my (fav)
 <angel> body asleep. mind awake...
 <torr> Open the third eye
 <vance> 1. Bear w/ star in sun
 <vance> 2. Horizontal #2
 <vance> 3. traditional bottom star 
 <vance> I'm surprised you didn't go with something more red from the beginning 
 <torr> Well it's hard to use Old Glory Red, white, seal green, Irish green, and walnut brown together
 <torr> When they touch it looks weird
 <torr> And without touching the colors some of the only ways I could think of to make it are the less extreme ones like Traditional Bottom Star
 <vance> I'm sure it'd look good in some type of bear and sickle design 
 <torr> In that one it's just not different enough, I think, to warrant a change from the current flag
 <vance> O had actually meant bottom star right text 
 <vance> Instead of traditional bottom
 <torr> We can move on to those once we get everyone on the same page regarding fullcommunism
 <vance> I think a minor change like traditional bottm would be good to symbolize calexit 
 <vance> Firm in our "california values" but now something different than what we were
 <torr> I think star at the bottom is kinda weird though
 <vance> We're dirty liberals though
 <vance> Idk how it would look on a stick though
 <vance> It might be over looked easily if it's on a stick
 <vance> Assuming the stick is on the left
 <peter> You're a (stick)
 <jacob> Anyone want to attend a thing with me at Moorpark College tmrw night at 7pm?
 <jacob> Free lecture/q&a/book signing by a guy who wrote a book on treatment of Native Americans by US gov. Book is called American Genocide so u can guess the focus. I'm going and can give ride
 <peter> I don't think I have anything planned, so sure. 
 <jacob> cool
 <ian> Might but not guaranteed
 <torr> Has anyone taken classes at multiple VC/MC/OC?
 <ian> As in taken classes at each at the same time? 
 <torr> Do I have to do anything to go to another one?
 <torr> Like I'm going to VC right now and I need to take classes that are only at Moorpark, do I just sign up online and show up or do I need to do something else?
 <ian> Pretty sure yeah. The most you would need is a transcript and it all goes through myvcccd
 <ian> Could be wrong tho
 <ian> RIP today I was going to do bear alone and it got cancelled
 <ian> I was ready for the challenge
 <vance> I was registered for both vc and mc at one point
 <nina> Guyz my dad designed a cool shirt 
 <vance> Depending on the class you may need to go MC to clear prereqs with a counselor 
 <vance> You will need a transcript 
 <nina> He made me a lot and they are free, really comfy long sleeves
 <nina> Nice color 
 <nina> Lmk if you want one
 <jacob> yo I'm down for a free chirt
 <jacob> What is the brand? Out of curiosity
 <nina> Hell yes what size
 <nina> He designed it
 <jacob> O cool. Didn't know if it was for a company or something
 <jacob> Also uhh, medium or large depending on fit
 <nina> Nope, he thought about it one day, decided he had a cool idea and then was like hey I made these shirts for you
 <nina> Hes great
 <jacob> That's awesome lol
 <ian> How did he know green was my favorite color 
 <nina> I guess brand name would be " FTV " or "fill the void"
 <nina> Dude like that's what I thought like I looove the color 
 <ian> Will they shrink a bit? I'm with Jacob on sizes 
 <nina> They will shrink a bit
 <vance> If you have to clear highschool classes then "you have to get a transcript from your highschool" but if you go to the front desk and ask for a copy of your ap/Ib scores it's printed on the transcript 
 <ian> Large for sure that would be super sweet
 <nina> Sweeet yes
 <vance> That is a nice color lol
 <nina> I was really impressed
 <nina> My dads so cute he was all like "they didn't turn out how I wanted them, they probably don't look good"
 <ian> Lmao as we're all like "gimme gimme"
 <nina> I know right it's so great! 
 <nina> He's gonna be so happy 
 <angel> Hey need expert opinion.
 <angel> U guys think this chicken's good to eat?
 <angel> With that grey black area on the skin
 <michael> looks weird 
 <michael> also experts don't exist 
 <michael> with that being said 
 <michael> eat it 
 <angel> Ok that's good enough for me
 <angel> Ur wisdom is appreciated
 <vance> When did you buy it 
 <michael> if it smells fine and isn't slimy after you wash it 
 <michael> it's probably fine 
 <angel> Altho to be on safe side I'm removing the suspicious area and mailing it to ur address for further inspection
 <angel> That cool?
 <michael> sounds good 
 <michael> I will conduct some experiment and report back 
 <angel> Its maybe 1 week old
 <angel> Its been in the fridge for 2 days with a hole in the seal
 <vance> lmao
 <peter> Just cut it off.
 <peter> Cook the chicken and eat it
 <peter> What doesn't kill you. 
 <peter> If it does
 <angel> I accept my fate
 <ian> You'll just poop a lot 
 <ian> Or die 
 <angel> These are acceptable terms. where do I sign?
 <peter> You've already signed it. 
 <peter> We all have.
 <jacob> Anyone else come to lecture?
 <jacob> Going soob
 <jacob> N
 <michael> I cannut
 <michael> programming project due tomorrow morning must complete 
 <jacob> WE GOIN SOOB HUUUEEEE
 <jacob> 4sho
 <vance> If anyone else likes harry potter I wanna see the midnight premier 
 <vance> Might be too late just realized that's tomorrow lol
 <taylor> Those shirts r neat could i have a large too 
 <taylor> Premiere is tmrw?
 <nina> Yessssss
 <vance> Yeah tomorrow 
 <jacob> Trumnp is just like volleymort and Hillary is Luna love good lmao
 <vance> Is this going to be out new team shirt?
 <vance> If we all wear it we have to join a kickball league or something 
 <ian> I'm okay with that 
 <vance> I'd actually prefer a dodgeball league
 <vance> Kickball is second best sport that's not really a sport
 <jacob> Watersports
 <vance> Ud be good at that 
 <vance> The whole harry potter stuff could've been avoided if voldemort just killed harry like a regular person would kill a baby
 <vance> By drop kicking him
 <jacob> I think muggles would win in a war bc guns
 <jacob> Like ya u can fly on a broom but literally we have tracking missiles and anti air guns u fool
 <vance> I've thought about that too
 <vance> But like killing ppl w/ magic is way cooler than killing ppl w/ bullrts
 <jacob> Oh they have a troll? I have a 200 round box of 7.62x51 bithces
 <jacob> Eat lead you frickinf occultists
 <vance> I'm pretty sure rail guns exist now too
 <jacob> Killing ppl with magic is rl dorky in hp
 <vance> Like it blast a magnetized metal rod
 <jacob> U just yell some weird mangled Latin and then they flop after getting hit with ghost jizz
 <vance> Killing ppl with magic is always cool u fkn tard
 <jacob> Ya like a fireball or some shit not gayass harrypooter words
 <jacob> Ya I got a word... Fuck You Wizard... 3 of em
 <michael> http://youtu.be/6xpeqGuZIys
 <michael> this shows u that wizard wins 
 <vance> That guy tried to rob someone in flip flops
 <vance> That's the real issue
 <jacob> Hmmm
 <jacob> That does provide a pretty strong case
 <jacob> But you see, that robberman did not obey the 30 foot rule. Always stay 30 feet from a wizard before engaging with firearm
 <jacob> Also the flip flops were a major tactical disadvantage
 <jacob> Biased video, maybe?
 <vance> Any regular wiz would have used expeliarmus right off the bat though
 <vance> So both parties were equally dumb 
 <michael> http://i.imgur.com/MauPLxg.gifv
 <vance> Which may imply there there was a control during the experiment 
 <ian> But like a full scale battle? Couldn't wizards just cast a shield spell while the rest attack from behind? 
 <ian> We don't have that "technology"
 <vance> I think in a full scale battle wizards would be better at espionage 
 <vance> Killing crucial muggles 
 <vance> Leaving the entire muggle army vulnerable 
 <jacob> Ya but wizards are vastly outnumbered
 <jacob> We're not talking about a line battle, this is friggin modern warfare, house to hohse. And, if they choose to hide out in the hills, well we put those Lockheed jets and peacekeepers to good use. Only one way to find out how much flak a wizard shield can handle.
 <michael> can't they just apparate away if at a disadvantage 
 <vance> Ya they can
 <jacob> wtf ur just making things up now. Don't forget fuckin LAND MINES bitch wizards gotta walk some time
 <michael> isn't everything made up though 
 <jacob> Wow way to be PHILOSOPHICAL ON ME
 <vance> They can apostate anywhere they've been before tho
 <vance> Apperate
 <jacob> Listen it is critical and obvious that the political elite that own this world and the Harry potter world would be well aware of these damn wizards and invest all of their mongies into this problem probably
 <vance> Ya but what kind of stuff would their mongies come up with
 <jacob> Anti wizard tech, baby...
 <vance> O nice 
 <vance> Didnt think of that
 <jacob> Maybe even dipping into the magical pool with their toesies, to summon demons from the beyond. Or how about American Dementors Task Force?
 <jacob> I'm not saying it wouldn't be bloody....
 <jacob> Oh there would be blood.....
 <jacob> Mud blood.....even.............
 <jacob> Fuckin nukes kid. Hogwarts, nuked. Diagon alley, nuked. Dead
 <jacob> Enjoy the nuclear winter, wizards.
 <jacob> You asked for it by being overpowered.
 <jacob> Nowhere to teleport now.
 <vance> Across the world homegirl
 <vance> Also portkeys and fire places 
 <jacob> N U C L E A R. W I N T E R.
 <torr> Muggles with AR-15s < wizards < muggles in tanks and planes < Muggles with glorious Mosin-Nagant
 <jacob> Moist nuggles
 <vance> What is the last thing 
 <michael> rly old bolt action rifle 
 <jacob> Soviet bolt action
 <jacob> Best gun in the world
 <jacob> You can piss on it. Eat it. Bury it in a german. Still work
 <jacob> Jk it jams a lot it's a meme gun
 <vance> Memes are a wizards greatest weakness
 <jacob> It doesn't rly jam a lot it's standard
 <jacob> It's cool
 <jacob> Meme wizaddddsdd yeehHh
 <torr> I think with CIA training the wizards win
 <vance> Who is the CIA trying to over throw by training wizards
 <jacob> The Wizards basketball team: are they wizards?
 <michael> what do u think MKULTRA was? they were training wizard.
 <torr> Probably some legitimate democratically elected government that wants to put an export tax on bananas
 <jacob> The CIA have detected communist influences among prominent wizard circles
 <torr> How is wizzard fromed?
 <vance> Do wizards have a democracy I can't remem
 <ian> So I'm walking to doggos when a street cleaner comes rolling through. Watched it run over an already dead rabbit, blasted it everywhere and the smell was putrid from 20 yards away still 
 <vance> Oops slept 45 mins too long 
 <nina> So I watched a motorcycle accident happen right in front of me on the freeway this morning 
 <ian> Oh jeez 
 <nina> He rolled it right in front of me in my lane
 <peter> That's a good way to start your mornings
 <peter> I can't wait to see what's in store.
 <torr> Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh my power is out
 <jacob> owned
 <peter> (work) 
 <torr> Report: 3% battery, no electricity, took a nap then played guitar for 3 hours. Exhausted both my memory and written songs. Too dark see anything.
 <torr> Thus I must venture out, into the beyond, in search or something, anything... salvation.
 <peter> A Starbucks with an outlet?
 <vance> Just woke up from nap
 <vance> I think the LSD reset my weed tolerance 
 <vance> I got knocked the fuck out

 <vance> I'm sorry about your eyesight pete
 <ian> Sitting like a good dog 
 <taylor> Coco just got home from the long shift as corpse sniffing dog
 <jacob> Coco the Corpse Sniffer
 <jacob> Locked eyes with some teenage boy thru the in n out drive thru window. Gave him a good state for 30 secs, I think I shattered his sense of security
 <jacob> I mean I gave him my best brain dead look/smile combo so he should lighten up
 <jacob> A good stare*
 <peter> Open hang at my house for a bit.
 <vance> Rn?
 <peter> Head over on ten 
 <peter> I'll be there about then
 <ian> I'm coming around 8/9 if anyone needs/wants a ride 
 <taylor> Ya ian could u give me and corey a ride?
 <ian> I'll let you know when I'm on my way 
 <taylor> Kk
 <jacob> how long can we be there Pete? I'm just eating dinner now, might head over in a bit tho
 <peter> Til around 10
 <torr> Party at tay's house
 <torr> My birthday is on the same day that John Brown, radical abolitionist was hanged for treason
 <ian> A special day indeed 
 <jacob> On my birthday, Heracles was born as marked by a solar eclipse
 <jacob> And now he is reborn...
 <jacob> I find myself at taco bell
 <jacob> lord have mercy
 <ian> I recently got the new taquito things 
 <ian> Pretty good
 <jacob> The whatnow
 <ian> Man I don't know what they call them I just asked for the taquitos and they knew 
 <ian> It's got chicken 
 <ian> Maybe some bugs 
 <ian> Carla's hair 
 <vance> I've had. Judy's hair but never Clara's 
 <vance> Oh Carla's 
 <jacob> u just piqued my curiosity is all 
 <jacob> I usually just ask for pure bufs
 <jacob> gsgsgd
 <peter> Cinnabon delights 
 <torr> Clara is a pretty name
 <ian> I think I like Torr760 better. It's original. Rolls right off the tongue 
 <angel> o ya well i think ur both pretty names
 <angel> how u like them apple?
 <angel> hey should i take intro to chicano studies or religion in America today?
 <angel> also tfw u forgot to add classes and can't take Ancient Magic anymore
 <ian> First you didn't pick 420 and now this angel 
 <angel> my life's spiraling out of control
 <ian> Did you wipe today?
 <vance> Chicanos in America today 
 <angel> o no i forgot
 <angel> thanks for reminding me
 <vance> I was awake for 8hrs yesterday
 <torr> "I have to watch Dance Moms for work and it's the worst show in the world" -my mom
 <torr> 1 hr episodes weekly
 <ian> Sometimes Brooke watches to watch how crazy those women are 
 <ian> It's pretty terrifying 
 <ian> More like Bad Moms 
 <peter> More like pushing their insecurities on their children.
 <peter> The TV show.
 <ian> Blows my mind that it's televised 
 <taylor> More like Bad Moms
 <michael> speaking of moms 
 <michael> my mom just accidentally drugged both of us 
 <ian> With what?
 <michael> she bought some kava honey from Hawaii not knowing was kava is 
 <michael> we ate some and then a second later turned to each other and at the same time were like "does your tongue feel numb?"
 <michael> "The roots of the plant are used to produce a drink with sedative, anesthetic, euphoriant, and entheogenic properties. Kava is consumed throughout the Pacific Ocean cultures of Polynesia, including Hawaii, Vanuatu, Melanesia and some parts of Micronesia for its sedating effects."

 <angel> u think the dnd board got him
 <vance> Yes the DnD board of executives 
 <vance> A conspiracy 
 <angel> wake upsheepl mike eleven was an inside job
 <vance> Mike was taken by the demagogue 
 <torr> If you would just read the damn about page
 <torr> "On Friday, January 4th, 2012, at  AM, young jew Michael Fisheler officially killed himself to death brutally murdered. Dead."
 <angel> O ya lol
 <angel> So tragic
 <jacob> Does anyone need a foldable cart. Kinda flimsy
 <taylor> What is that
 <michael> seems to be some sort of cart
 <michael> perhaps with folding capabilities?
 <taylor> doubt it
 <taylor> What does it do
 <jacob> It's a trap for large rodents
 <torr> Rodents of unusual size*
 <angel> I don't believe they exist
 <jacob> Heh maybe where you live, pal!
 <vance> What kind of crime do I have to commit to get pardoned by uncle barry
 <vance> Criz has a rodent phobia bc the Philippines has huge rats lmao
 <vance> I bet he'd cry if you made him touch one
 <jacob> Break onto white house property to give Barry a handmade arts and crafts gift. He will forgive u and put it on his fridge.

 <jacob> Fucking reptilians, am I right
 <vance> UC or CSU?
 <vance> Prob not econ no one likes econ
 <vance> Why would they do that
 <vance> If reg deadlines are Nov 30
 <vance> Terrible 
 <jacob> For UC
 <jacob> And idk man
 <jacob> According to ~statistical evidence~ those who applied after Nov. 30th last year were less likely to be accepted. Either bc the admissions ppl had a preference or the ppl who submitted later were dumb slackers or something???
 <jacob> THE DATA WE NEED MORE DATA
 <jacob> I'm not gonna wait though

 <vance> It went for a swim and never came back
 <ian> Tell me more 
 <vance> Well sometimes when I sleep I punch
 <vance> When I was 11 me and my cousin were sharing a bed
 <vance> In a hotel in Florida 
 <vance> I had punched him in my sleep
 <vance> And he punched me back out of anger 
 <vance> That was the last incident of my sleep punch
 <vance> Until 2 nights ago
 <vance> I punched my water 
 <vance> Right onto my laptop
 <vance> I submerged in rice
 <vance> Tried again today
 <ian> Sleep Puncher coming to a theatre near you 
 <vance> And I could hear my poor laptop sizzle in hell
 <ian> That's brutal 
 <ian> Dream Puncher is better 
 <vance> Ya so don't sleep with me
 <ian> I haven't been punched in the face since Mike 
 <vance> U gonna wake up with a black eye and sexual dissatisfaction 
 <ian> Hunter and I still need to punch each other
 <ian> That's all I wake up with
 <vance> Why hahahah
 <ian> I think we just agreed on it years ago
 <vance> You should wait till you're 80
 <vance> Then punch each other as old men
 <ian> Either that or when we're prime
 <ian> Peaking in our youth 
 <vance> I think prime will be 5-7 years
 <ian> Using all of the strength that we'll ever have left in our lives 
 <vance> Only work on core and triceps 
 <vance> Ultimate punching machines
 <vance> I guess legs too
 <ian> And back 
 <vance> A lot of drive from legs
 <ian> And glutes
 <vance> You will break you hands on each others faces
 <ian> I'm gonna be squeezing those cheeks 
 <vance> Never thought about how full body punching was
 <ian> His cheeks I mean 
 <ian> I want them as firm as possible 
 <vance> Mmmmm baby
 <vance> So do i

 <taylor> Its not like full auto he can still save himself
 <taylor> But its a better driver than me so 
 <torr> I think full auto is banned
 <taylor> Ya it is banned 
 <taylor> He said when he got it the dealer told him the auto works great
 <taylor> And that they have like desert arenas where cars just drive themselves around all day 
 <torr> Soon they won't even need us anymore

 <peter> R
 <torr> Official secret hitler box set is out
 <peter> Can you send me a link to where I can buy it. 
 <torr> Secret Hitler is now available at http://secrethitler.com or on Amazon http://amzn.to/2fIdQTH.
 <torr> Do I need to send transcripts right now or do I wait until I get accepted?
 <jacob> good question
 <vance> Pretty sure you wait
 <vance> On the application it said do not send any transcripts unless told otherwise
 <ian> Man the world of soccer is a beautiful thing 
 <ian> Clubs are trading players for free and big name players are donating to keep the team going 
 <ian> Also the team they were going to play conceded so the team wins the championship 
 <jacob> that's cool man
 <jacob> Do the fans just continue to beat each other up or are they trading friends too
 <ian> Context: full team except for 3 died in a plane crash
 <ian> And yes
 <jacob> Oh
 <torr> I forgot my password to this application site and my security question is "how could you?"
 <vance> Lmao
 <vance> I forgot mine too
 <vance> Mine was "first car"
 <vance> Accord wasn't working
 <vance> Then I realized I wrote Twinkie 
 <torr> I guess I wrote it back before I started doing variations on the same thing so I just brute forced it with like 30 tries
 <torr> So I didn't really forget my password, just which way it was written
 <vance> That happens to me when my old password was just fruitloops
 <vance> Before I added the 2
 <torr> What CSUs should I apply to?
 <vance> So far I'm doing SLO and SDSU
 <vance> I'm not sure what others but I feel like I should pick more
 <vance> Maybe Pomona or SF BC I like the city of SF but don't know anything about the school
 <torr> Let's go to Monterey together
 <torr> And relive tortilla flat
 <ian> Hey that's where I want to transfer
 <torr> There's also east bay which is like south of Oakland
 <vance> I hardly remember tortilla flat
 <vance> Actually I don't remember it at all
 <vance> Just that there was a lot of wine
 <torr> That's basically the whole plot
 <torr> Dude inherits a house and his buddies drink lots of wine and convince other people to buy them wine
 <vance> Oh that's right
 <vance> Ian you want to go to Monterey?
 <ian> Yeah but not for another year at least bc coast guard and blah
 <vance> I don't see any issue with taking your time with education
 <vance> Like ur a working man 
 <vance> Ur living life
 <vance> No point in rushing life if it's going good
 <torr> >joins coast guard >gets stationed in Monterey
 <ian> Ur gonna make me tear up
 <ian> Military and their SY5T3M isn't worth 
 <ian> Unless ur in it for 20+years
 <torr> Wait there are like no harbors in Monterey or Santa Cruz
 <vance> I was trying to tell Criz that military prob wasn't worth it to pay for his med school
 <vance> Like doctors already pay off their loans the fastest
 <torr> He should just go to Cuba
 <vance> And the type he wants to be would put him right on the middle of combat prob
 <vance> What if trump reverses Cuba stuff
 <torr> It's free as long as you spend like 1 year helping people in Cuba and a few helping people in your home country or something
 <torr> Then he'll be in glorious cuba
 <ian> Criz takes Cuba
 <vance> I think Criz would like Cuban girls too
 <vance> He likes butts
 <ian> I thought trump was saying fuck you Cuba already like the day after Castro died
 <vance> He was talking mad trash
 <vance> Along with many other republic politicians
 <ian> Hopefully it'll all fall apart when I have to confront the realities of being an "adult"
 <ian> Well b4 please so I don't have that added stress 
 <taylor> Hopefully trump chooses us to be part of his youth outreach program s
 <torr> I mean literally everyone in US government has to hate Cuba to get those Florida votes
 <taylor> So that we ascend rather than age 
 <torr> They have camps for that
 <vance> Does Florida even matter can we just let the alligators take over 
 <ian> (alligator)
 <torr> All these apps like "hey you sure you want to send your ACT score? Transfers don't have to"
 <torr> Bitch I got 35/36 hell yeah I do
 <vance> I got 23 in writing
 <vance> Way to make me feel bad
 <torr> I got like 27 in writing or something but 35 composite somehow
 <vance> My highest was 28 in math lmao
 <torr> I think average for all is supposed to be like 22
 <torr> So you're above average (thumb)
 <vance> Oh nice
 <vance> BC my SAT was as average as it gets
 <vance> 1690 I think 
 <torr> "Yeah ACT averages | English: 20.3 | Math: 20.9 | Reading: 21.3 | Science: 20.8 | Composite: 21.0"
 <vance> I shouldve retaken it just to ace it
 <vance> Omg yesss above average
 <vance> I want others below me to make me feel better
 <torr> Kurt got 2100/2400 on SAT and his mom made him retake it lol
 <vance> Omfg csu mentor doesn't take AMEX
 <vance> Ur mom did the same you didn't she?
 <torr> No one takes Amex because Amex screws stores over
 <torr> No she wanted me to retake but then I got ACT score back and she said it was fine
 <vance> Do they have a crazy high rate or something 
 <vance> My mom def wanted me to take sat a third time
 <vance> But she said it was a waste of money BC I didn't study so she gave up lol
 <vance> Which is true
 <torr> They always side with customers no matter what and most of their customers are rich peeps who start lots of high dollar arguments
 <torr> So most places says it's just not worth the risk and most people have master/visa/chase
 <vance> Omfg
 <vance> My csu mentor locked
 <vance> BC my mom's laptop keeps messing my password up
 <torr> Because they don't like amex
 <vance> I think it lags and I hit enter too early
 <vance> Why do they make me call tech support to unlock
 <vance> Wjy
 <vance> Why
 <vance> Why
 <vance> I hate this
 <vance> I hate this so much
 <vance> Holy shit
 <vance> 35 minute hold time
 <vance> I can't do this
 <vance> I'm not going to college
 <vance> Fuck it
 <ian> I was gone for 10 MINUTES VANCE 
 <ian> I can't be there for everything 
 <ian> How did you manage to do this? 
 <ian> Just drop put 
 <vance> I have no idea
 <vance> I logged in before 
 <vance> I left it idle it logged me out
 <vance> I tried to log back in
 <vance> I typed my password in another window copy and pasted it in
 <vance> So I know it was right
 <vance> And it just kept saying it was wrong 
 <vance> Now I'm trying to make a new password
 <vance> But I says it doesn't fit the requirements
 <vance> It literally says only numbers and letter
 <vance> I put 2fruitloops
 <vance> It keeps saying it doesn't work
 <vance> Also the tech support number is spelled out in letters
 <ian> Is the 2 after? 
 <ian> Do you know who you are?
 <ian> What do the numbers mean Mason? 
 <vance> That wasnt my original password
 <vance> The shittiest website I have ever been on
 <vance> Ppl applying on this site can make a better website
 <ian> You should write a formal letter 
 <michael> Part of my dad's heart was acting weird and beating too fast, which could have lead to major heart attack or stroke. Today he had a surgery where they literally threaded a catheter through a vein in his leg all the way to the heart and essentially zapped it to fix it. Everything went well but holy shit how badass is that? Maybe my dad has super charged super powers now that they zapped his heart. 
 <michael> Also medical science is crazy like wtf they performed a heart surgery without even opening him up 
 <vance> That's crazy I'm glad your dad is doing well
 <vance> He's going to recover 100%?
 <vance> My sister was actually telling me about doing that before 
 <vance> Or watching someone do it idk lol
 <ian> Man what's that movie called with Jason Stathom when he has to electrocute himself to keep his fake heart beating?
 <vance> Got my new comp too
 <vance> Static shock
 <ian> Proud of the dad Mike 
 <ian> He did it 
 <torr> That was dr. Strange
 <ian> Hey I know my actors pal
 <vance> PRAISE
 <vance> My wait time was only 22 minutes
 <vance> Should I pick international econ or public policy econ
 <vance> O there's regular econ I'll pick that

 <torr> Design though? Yeah, meh, or naw?
 <ian> What's the symbolism behind it?
 <torr> The arrow points West because that's where CA is and it can also be seen as like a shovel for the gold rush. The bear is now kind of moving forward toward wider choices, like a reverse funnel. Also a c because that's the first letter in california

 <jacob> Le chicken nugget
 <nina> Hey guys dunno if anyone is looking for a job, but wanted to extend the info. The paper warehouse will soon need a part-time coordinator. It's not a route or anything. You'd work Mon-Fri 12am-5am (one day off a week though) at $12/hr. Fairly easy to get promoted from what I've seen. Lmk!
 <nina> Job duties include counting and stacking papers for the courier's and cleaning up around warehouse 
 <nina> Boss is cool also 
 <jacob> Wegoneot
 <vance> How about them violent delights though
 <ian> I was amazed 
 <ian> Get it 
 <ian> aMAZEd
 <vance> I can't seem to get to the center of the joke
 <ian> Ty for that 
 <vance> (cowboy)
 <ian> Did you end up liking it?
 <vance> The ending?
 <vance> Yea I was real satisfied
 <ian> Finale in general but yes
 <ian> Humans are the worst
 <vance> Wbu
 <vance> #not their world
 <ian> I was giddy as heck
 <vance> William really shocked me
 <ian> That got me going
 <ian> It was so well orchestrated
 <vance> I've been non stop confused for so long
 <vance> And everything just came together
 <ian> I like being as vague as possible about this
 <vance> We should just finish this Convo up with a huge spoiler
 <ian> By all means
 <ian> It was all a simulation
 <vance> Maze of spoilers
 <ian> >>SPOILERS<<
 <peter> Spoil 
 <vance> Lmao
 <vance> "Josh from customer service" called me
 <michael> did u get social engineered Vince 
 <michael> did u give them all your bank passwords 
 <vance> I meant to put on speaker phone but I accidentally hung up
 <vance> He was offering my Disneyland tickets
 <vance> He sounded just like a commercial a very nice voice
 <ian> Were you ready for those tickets? 
 <vance> Yeah I really wanted them
 <ian> Man you should call back
 <ian> And try to give him tickets 
 <vance> That's the least I could do for such a kind heart person
 <ian> I wonder if he got ditched or something and just wanted a friend to go with him 
 <vance> No I won them
 <vance> From customer service
 <ian> Oh my bad 
 <ian> Joe Biden said he would run in 2020
 <ian> He'd be 78 by then 
 <michael> I'm going to make a chat bot and have it run in 2020 
 <michael> certainly it'll do a better job of managing twitter
 <ian> Lol like in black mirror 
 <michael> haven't seen latest season 
 <michael> :0 
 <ian> Actually it was first 
 <michael> haven't seen that either 
 <michael> lolol 
 <ian> MIKE
 <michael> it's on the list 
 <michael> I'm still working through marvel stuff 
 <ian> A tv cartoon character that's crude and what not runs and wins lol. The guy just voices it live 
 <ian> I think it's tv 
 <michael> but srsly when finals are over I'm gonna try to make a chat bot and train it with only our messages on the line group from the past couple years of logs 
 <ian> Could you include the chat bot in the group?
 <michael> hmm that's a pretty great idea 
 <michael> I'd have to see what LINE's API supports 
 <michael> I mean they have those translator bots, just dunno if they let the people make me 
 <michael> em*
 <ian> I hope so 
 <ian> I bet it'll come up with some great responses 
 <michael> it will be a gestalt, it will take the world by storm, I'll let it loose on Internet forums and soon after it will become the hegemon like in ender's game 
 <vance> Does that mean it'll respond to things the way we respond to things
 <ian> I was going to say haha
 <ian> To the Ender's game reference
 <michael> if I get it to work, yeah it'll be like an amalgamation of how we talk 
 <torr> Peter becomes the hegemon though
 <torr> By having fake debates with his sister in newspapers under pseudonyms 
 <michael> ya doesn't he get his start by writing political discussion with Valentine on the Internet forums 
 <michael> I remembered it as Internet not newspapers 
 <ian> Yeah they play as two anonymous characters with two different political stand points over the "net"
 <ian> Or ya pseudonyms
 <michael> from Internet blogger to world leader in 10 easy steps 
 <ian> (wow) 
 <jacob> Grammy nominations shit as always
 <jacob> Except, somehow Tycho made it to the electronic music genre??
 <jacob> Wow zoo I say
 <ian> That's a win
 <jacob> Prob will lose to Flume or someone tho
 <torr> We should have a Grammy betting pool
 <ian> Beyonce
 <ian> Done
 <torr> You don't think it'll be Adele?
 <ian> Drake ofc
 <torr> Drake for Best Rapping Performance in ""Pop Style"" Kekeke
 <ian> It's all bad 
 <nina> Pls watch this https://youtu.be/KRYURVuIC3o
 <ian> Oh yes I've seen this
 <peter> If Anderson paak doesn't win contemp
 <nina> It's so good
 <torr> I really like that Jamie XX music video but they'll give it to Beyonce because hers has a message or something
 <torr> For best music video
 <ian> For Gosh? 
 <torr> Yeah
 <peter> Gosh is epic
 <peter> (oh) 
 <peter> My
 <peter> Gosh
 <peter> Easy easy
 <ian> That would be awesome but not likely
 <taylor> Suicide squad has 2 grammy noms this is final step in complete granny delegitimization 
 <ian> So it's based on what 7-16 year olds like
 <taylor> U blasted fool its based on the l ron hubbard possessing will smith
 <taylor> Also 7-16 yo prob not target demo for the kill urself gang
 <taylor> Scientologists love that stuff tho
 <ian> Why not I'm sure that's who saw it the most
 <torr> I just listened to most of that flume album
 <torr> Do people like that?
 <ian> It's not their best imo
 <torr> It sounds like it's trying so hard to be different and groundbreaking but it mostly just annoys me
 <ian> That's what was wrong with it
 <ian> Sometimes when artists go out of their realm it just doesn't work
 <ian> Muse and the Killers did that
 <torr> And train
 <ian> I stopped listening to them for half a year 
 <peter> You've got to find the mood and narrative for the flume album.
 <peter> But it's pretty all over the place
 <peter> Not consistent enough 
 <torr> There doesn't seem to be a central theme
 <peter> Like the Malibu album by Anderson paak is golden
 <peter> It even has smooth transitions between songs 
 <ian> Even Gambino's new album people are going to focus more on the bad than the good 
 <torr> One song has vocals and the hip hop drum pattern then the next is in like 7/15 time or some shit and is super experimental on the Flume album
 <ian> When really the good is historic 
 <ian> He brought it back so beautifully 
 <ian> I would want my children to listen to it 
 <ian> Specifically Baby Boy
 <peter> Seriously 
 <peter> I'm listening to that rn
 <peter> Terrified 
 <peter> Zombies
 <peter> My favorites.
 <ian> No no
 <ian> I can't do boogieman it's not for me
 <ian> Or zombies 
 <peter> Have some love is just feel good everyone should like that somng.
 <peter> I think California is fun.
 <peter> I can't really do riot
 <peter> Boogie man when he says yes I can
 <ian> But his voiceeeeeee it turns me off from the rest of the song 
 <peter> Ok Red bone sold me on the album 
 <ian> Completely 
 <peter> Yeah I feel that. 
 <ian> Redbone and Baby Boy made me appreciate Me and Your Mama so much more 
 <ian> I understood 
 <torr> I'm pretty confused as to why they haven't split up dance/electronic into at least like 3 different groups
 <torr> Like who's to say Flume's experimental stuff is better than Tycho's ambient or Underworld's techno... then there's this Louie Vega Nu-Disco all in the same section
 <ian> Bc too many awards
 <peter> Type in Orbic helicopters camarillo in google
 <nina> Michael pls help 
 <peter> Look at the second result
 <nina> Whyyyyyyyyyy howwww
 <ian> HAHAHAHAHA
 <ian> You should call google about that one 
 <torr> Ahahahahahaha
 <ian> That's also brutal but I had a good laugh
 <torr> Wait why does it do that
 <torr> It's not even in the page source
 <jacob> HAHAHAHA
 <jacob> I'm dying
 <ian> Someone just changed the name which makes it funnier 
 <jacob> tbh I don't like redbone very much
 <jacob> I'm gay
 <jacob> Tory, that's always been my problem with Grammys
 <jacob> It's obviously so like commercial focused. They throw in some less known artists to spice it up or even let them win sometimes but most of it seems totally arbirtrary besides the top dog ones that probably were chosen to win when nominated
 <jacob> But maybe they have judges for each category that have weird tastes or some are like normies and some are music ppl
 <torr> It's not even the commercialism thing. I feel like they just pick what they think would be to pin a badge on and not the actual best
 <torr> Would be good*
 <torr> As for too many genres, I mean there's rock, alternative, metal which all used to be under rock. They could do like ambient, dance, and I dunno some kind of all encompassing term for drum centric stuff
 <jacob> Ya true. I meant more like the idea of the ""grammys"" is just hyping up the event and advertising and the esteem itself, not the merit behind the music And yeah there need to be way more genres wtf
 <jacob> and stop giving away Grammy for comedy albums lmao
 <torr> I don't know how you're supposed to compare disco to ambient, it's like Slipknot vs. The Killers like wtf
 <torr> There's probably a better alt example than the Killers but you know
 <ian> I giggled @ that good example
 <torr> Like 2013 Mumford & Sons got album of the year over El Camino by the Black Keys
 <torr> I feel like it was just because they were "refreshing" or some shit
 <ian> It was the message dude 
 <torr> I just feel like you'd find way more people who say El Camino is a better album than Babel

 <torr> The KKK says they aren't white supremacist and that's apparently newsworthy 
 <ian> Bc they're relevant now
 <nina> Okay so it's probably "politically correct" or I mean wait isn't that the excuse they use to be racist? 😌
 <ian> It's all bad
 <torr> They say it's a media smear campaign
 <torr> I'm not surprised about the KKK claiming that, I'm just surprised people don't immediately laugh in their face and actually think it's worth writing an article about
 <nina> Honestly 
 <nina> What ever happened to the saying actions speak louder than words?
 <ian> I don't think I can go home because of the parade
 <ian> This is ridiculous 
 <ian> I'm very upset
 <nina> Where are you?

 <torr> The snowman cookie holder is back to make my mom crazy and my grandma cry
 <torr> 2 years ago my grandma won it in our white elephant then she left it out until like March because she didn't want it to break in the garage. But there wasn't in room in the kitchen for it so my mom got all mad and wanted to throw it away and made my grandma cry.  Welcome to the Lewis household where refrigerators and cookie jars are a major point of contention
 <vance> Better that than trump 
 <vance> I just had the edgiest dream
 <vance> It was thrilling I'm so sweaty
 <vance> Post apocalyptic secret underground stuff
 <vance> I was a part if an unlikely group of ppl
 <vance> Our hide out was under a really nice hotel for the richest ppl
 <vance> No one would ever suspect
 <torr> Did you eat the rich?
 <vance> I ended bringing in a bounty for $422
 <vance> Which was a lot
 <vance> The biggest before that was 106
 <vance> The thing is because of our hide out it was hard to turn in the bounty
 <vance> BC outside of the hotel are lurkers waiting for ppl with money to come out of the hotel
 <vance> But the bodies are picked up by drone
 <vance> We also player Robin Hood we stole from the rich and gave to the poor
 <vance> I had met my group BC I got into a fight with one of them
 <angel> It was no dream vance
 <vance> I think angel was in it a little too
 <vance> The hotel was one of many points that leads to a Gian underground world type thing
 <vance> It was basically a big rave
 <angel> You have peered through the veil of time
 <vance> Well the CIA concluded Russia did the hacks during the election and the trump team dismissed then lmao
 <vance> So maybe post nuclear
 <angel> It's happening
 <vance> It was scary though
 <angel> Everyone in the bunker
 <vance> Everyone is constantly trying to rob and murder you
 <vance> I forced myself to wake up
 <vance> It was too intense for me
 <vance> I'm too sweaty
 <angel> Greenseeing takes its toll on the body
 <vance> Is greenseeing looking into the future?
 <angel> Yea
 <vance> I think I only caught a glimpse of angel but couldn't get to him in the rave
 <vance> I havent seen anyone else in Trump's America 
 <angel> No one can reach me behind the rave. 
 <vance> I don't know for sure if you survived
 <vance> I mean probably not that many ppl died
 <vance> Underground is the only safe place from ppl
 <vance> But there are also scary post nuke monsters down there
 <vance> After the race there was an attack by them
 <angel> That sounds rad
 <vance> Only some ppl were killed
 <vance> It was a really vivid dream
 <vance> I ate spaghetti at 3am I think that's what did it
 <angel> Eat more spaghetti
 <vance> I strangled 2 ppl wang
 <angel> Only the strong survive
 <angel> U did good
 <vance> We were in Chicago btw
 <vance> There was a chance the rapper concert above ground
 <peter> I'm crying
 <peter> Very funny
 <peter> Both Tor and Vance
 <torr> Nice
 <angel> Nice
 <torr> I bet I could get my mom to "accidentally" break the snowman cookie jar
 <angel> could u put cookies in the cookie jar?
 <torr> Yeah but it's probably full of dust
 <angel> Poll "What should I do rn?"
 <angel> Also slavery is freedom
 <vance> Finishing up some hw
 <vance> Then play CSGO with me
 <vance> In like an hour
 <angel> Ok I'm gonna do laundry also

 <vance> Angel your pillow is mine
 <vance> http://m.petmd.com/cat/wellness/evr_ct_hypoallergenic_cat_breeds
 <angel> i also forgot my good toothbrush at the apartment
 <angel> dang it
 <angel> 68% IS A SOLID B 
 <angel> LETS GOOOOOO
 <angel> But actually I could do better. We all could do better. Take a moment to reflect on that
 <peter> (reflect) 
 <vance> Yuan from my dream thought so
 <vance> He was a radical
 <vance> There was a conference of a bunch of men 
 <vance> And a few women
 <vance> But the issue was whether men should continue standing peeing
 <vance> Or just sit down
 <vance> Yuan wanted everyone to sit
 <vance> There was a big argument
 <vance> Then... (I know this isn't how it's done)
 <vance> But Yuan goes behind one of the standing pee activist 
 <vance> And sticks a long narrow blade in his ear 
 <vance> Lobotomizing him
 <vance> Then there's a giants uproar
 <vance> Everyone takes arms
 <vance> There's a lot of lobotomies but also murders
 <vance> Lobotomies on both sides
 <ian> I'll give you a lobotomy
 <vance> Torward the end 
 <vance> There's 3 standing pee
 <vance> Vs Yuan 
 <vance> I'm special BC sometimes I sit
 <vance> And sometimes I stand 
 <vance> But both the other guys on standing pee end up dying 
 <vance> And that's where the dream always enss
 <vance> Ends
 <vance> This is like the 3rd time I've had this dream
 <vance> Yuan is a kinda like a Buddhist monk looking dude
 <ian> Internal dilemma
 <vance> Not really Yuan is a psyco
 <ian> He's just misunderstood
 <torr> (isee) So you are internally conflicted on whether or not it is right to sit and this has caused you great stress. I suggest only standing, in resistance to your id to overcome this difficult and gain greater control of your mind. 
 <vance> This is the largest internal conflict in my life
 <vance> And probably the largest I eternal conflict anyone had ever heard of
 <vance> So you think Yuan is wrong to lobotomize all those ppl
 <vance> What if I give up standing pee completely
 <ian> You must choose your own path
 <ian> Will you sit with Yuan or stand with the others 
 <vance> What if there is no right or wrong path
 <vance> I'm the bridge between worlds
 <ian> It'll all come down to that day 
 <ian> Dream prob ends bc that's when you step in 
 <ian> You'll never know 
 <vance> That's gonna be the biggest moment of my life
 <torr> I think you should just always use a catheter
 <vance> Do catheters hold poop too?
 <torr> No you should stand to poop
 <michael> It's only natural 
 <vance> But squatty potty
 <michael> tell me of one other animal that sits to poop 
 <michael> furthermore, tell me of one other animal that wears pants while popping 
 <michael> you can't. boom.
 <peter> I think squatting is better for the movement of the (boom)(boom)
 <peter> We should get bidets.
 <torr> Ideally you want to poop while suspended in a tank of brine of equal density to your body
 <torr> Like a fish
 <vance> Right side up?
 <vance> Or horizonal 
 <torr> The way fish do it
 <peter> Everywhere?
 <peter> Speaking of (shit)
 <peter> I'm at 4035

 <peter> The posting got deleted
 <nina> Welp that was fast lol 
 <nina> https://www.showmetherent.com/2209-Camilar-Dr-Camarillo-CA-93010
 <nina> This is even better, with a yard😍 with 4 ppl only $463 per person. 
 <jacob> Too many places to choose from, overpriced, too much variety, valley is 40 miles away and delivery is often a gamble @_@
 <jacob> is what I mene
 <jacob> That place looks prty nice tho
 <jacob> Are drive420's "house nugs" any good? Apparently they're doing a $150 oz for them
 <nina> Agreed about the weed
 <nina> If you ever wanna use my deals from green cuisine lemme know 
 <nina> And yes honestly it's a catch! 
 <jacob> The house or the house nugs? Lol
 <jacob> What sort of deals?
 <nina> Lol house is a catch, im not sure about the house bugs 
 <nina> Lol nugs
 <nina> Each day I get an email from GC with 1-2 special deals. For example, today it is this 
 <nina> There are different deals each day but they are pretty consistent
 <nina> Thurs
 <nina> Wed
 <nina> And tues
 <nina> Are the best ones
 <jacob> How's the bud quality?
 <nina> Pretty great, never had any complaints 
 <nina> Also sometimes they have this Nativ bubblehash for only $25/g and it's like bubbleman quality almost 
 <nina> Hunter and I kept a little to let Michael try it so you're welcome to also if you'd like
 <nina> Like 73 micron shit

 <jacob> Wait do the dogos count for half oz? $160 oz? :0
 <nina> I have no idea lol I'll find out
 <jacob> Idk if I want that much but it seems like a good deal lol
 <nina> I don't think they have that for the ounces 
 <jacob> Any idea of they do split DOG Is?
 <jacob> dooogoos
 <nina> What
 <jacob> like, if I go for 1/4 of one strain, could I get another 1/4 in the same price rangem
 <nina> Ahhhhhhhh I see
 <nina> And I think they would 
 <nina> Did you check out the hybrid specials?
 <nina> They have a shit ton of DOGOS
 <nina> and specials. More specials than DOGOS 
 <jacob> are their specials just more dankerino?
 <jacob> 2 many choices whew
 <jacob> Sry for all the questions
 <nina> Both are high quality
 <nina> No worries 
 <nina> I've been using GC for awhile, they're really good
 <nina> Only downside is they take awhile to deliver 
 <nina> But to me it is worth it

 <torr> I'll find a honey in Italian class
 <torr> Dw
 <vance> Ooo baby
 <vance> Putting the romance in romance language
 <peter> Almost as bad as cheating in rage cage, and letting your friend pay the price.
 <peter> Call her your Bella principessa 
 <torr> And then get killed by Nazis? 
 <taylor> Anyone got that pic of pete w the good angle?
 <taylor> Only say it 4 times lookin for the 5th
 <michael> I got you 
 <taylor> O sweet i was lookin all over
 <michael> So inspirational. 
 <vance> The program for my online course doesn't let you see other replies unless you also reply
 <vance> And there was a discussion board assignment where we have to introduce ourselves
 <vance> I wrote 2 sentences 
 <vance> Everyone else wrote long ass paragraphs 
 <ian> Lol what did you say
 <vance> Hi my name is Vance Nguyen and I'm and economics major.

 <michael> http://i.imgur.com/hKONDKp.gifv
 <torr> The gays are known to be quite promiscuous

 <michael> Has science gone too far? 
 <michael> Furthermore, what is America doing about the bed sheet entanglement epidemic? 
 <michael> Open your eyes people 
 <michael> I like cheese as much as the next guy. But the data doesn't lie. 
 <vance> Death by Dutch oven 
 <ian> Are you kidding I feel like that's so much cheese to eat 
 <ian> Obviously fake
 <michael> That's nothing. The French consumed 57.1 lbs of cheese on average in 2013 alone.
 <torr> This is fake news SAD!
 <michael> *leans into mic* WRONG 
 <torr> *leans into mike*
 <peter> Sorry didn't see you there.
 <torr> My grandma thinks the only reason anyone would go to a shooting range is if they're preparing to kill people
 <vance> It's true

 <vance> Do you think she'd ravt the same way about archery hahah

 <angel> U could roll back to an old driver
 <torr> I mean yeah but like wtf
 <angel> Yea idk pretty lame
 <michael> Reminds me of this anti virus I tried out once that wanted me to sign in with Facebook or social media. And it would prompt me to share my boot up speeds every time I started up 
 <michael> "Hmm I can't think of any useful features to add or bugs to fix. Let's add social media integration. To everything. Ever."
 <torr> Next thing you know you'll have to sign in to twitter to wear your pants
 <jacob> Getting started with your new Guess jeans! Please sign in.

 <jacob> "I am currently reading Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, which is Rand's magnum opus outlining her theology of Objectivism and the benefits of Capitalism. Many opponents see Objectivism and Rand's ideologies to be selfish and reckless, through non sequitur reasoning and straw-man arguments. Despite not completely identifying with Rand's ideas, I was able to use logic principles to better effectively play devil's advocate and spur conversation and thoughts about Objectivism and what it truly means to be altruistic."
 <jacob> why do I instantly hate this person in my class
 <jacob> Read: "I am currently reading Atlas Shrugged. . . magnum opus. . . many straw-like opponents think she is mean and selfish because they use bad arguments? But I actually understood it and now I know some shit"
 <michael> Yikes 
 <michael> dat word salad 
 <michael> I too like spurring conversation and thoughts 
 <jacob> Posted in the "connecting [logic] class to life and other tales of logic" section.

 <jacob> Yo I am ~1% European Jewish
 <michael> Did you get ancestry tested
 <jacob> yah
 <jacob> I am one of u mike
 <jacob> Also 27% Irish and 21% Italian, my strongest genes
 <jacob> Other than just western european
 <taylor> Quality stuff jacob besides the greek part hopefully we all get our genes tested 
 <taylor> U know for the information
 <jacob> I will be deleted in the coming purges
 <taylor> Thats p fun tho how irish is ur dad
 <jacob> I'm more Irish than him
 <jacob> In terms of active genes
 <taylor> O i dont understand
 <angel> Jacob has unlocked his hidden Irish potential
 <taylor> Is that how sense 8 ends
 <jacob> U can pass on genes that are inactive in u personally
 <angel> Yea they're all Irish
 <jacob> So a kid might have more of their grandparents traits than their parents
 <jacob> And so on
 <taylor> Ic
 <jacob> That's a rough way of explaining it
 <jacob> I'd have to know his family tree p much and then their family tree and so on
 <jacob> It's by no means a perfect science u kno
 <taylor> Did u send like a sample of u how do u do it
 <jacob> I spit in a thing
 <jacob> And sent it
 <taylor> Oh did ur family do it
 <jacob> Yah we all just compared ours
 <taylor> Cool
 <taylor> Im gonna check ito ut
 <jacob> There are more advanced places that map all ur genes and tell u shiet
 <jacob> This one is mainly for ethnicity/ancestry purposes
 <jacob> and u can find ppl with similar stuff to help map ancestry
 <vance> Tay just wants to find out if there's Jew in him
 <vance> You can't be one of us
 <jacob> U just gotta believe Tay
 <vance> I'd probably be 98% Chinese and 2% ghengis khan
 <angel> michael i have a jewish question
 <angel> is it acceptable for me to attend a b'nai b'rith congregation
 <angel> also what is b'nai b'rith?
 <michael> i had to look that up
 <michael> i thought you were asking about a brit milah for some reason
 <michael> some really old jew organization that fights anti semites?
 <angel> that's what Wikipedia says
 <michael> seems chill
 <angel> i was wondering if it'd be appropriate
 <michael> yah go for it
 <angel> like if I needed jewish heritage or if its an open thing
 <angel> ok cool
 <michael> idk if their reform jews
 <angel> i need to do a field study of a religious site for my religion in Americas class
 <michael> they're usually pretty accepting and open minded
 <angel> cool its either b'nai b'rith congregation or mahakankala buddhist center
 <angel> I kinda want to do the buddhist center bcuz i think the names cooler but b'nai b'rith is closer
 <angel> what do you think?
 <michael> i personally would do the buddhist center
 <michael> but maybe thats because ive heard enough about the troubles of the jews
 <michael> i mean the synagogue gave me "The Jewish People - 4000 years of survival" hardcover for my bar mitzvah
 <angel> yea lol i see what you mean
 <michael> if that tells you anything
 <angel> yea i think im going to go buddha on this one
 <angel> thanks for your jewish expertise michael
 <torr> Buddhist temples are pretty cool
 <torr> There's a part of the "services" or whatever where the monks just go like "OK everyone meditate" and they just sit in the front and hit a bell
 <torr> And the incense is cool
 <vance> U guys still dabbin?
 <vance> Just finished my hw

 <vance> I was ready for you guys to say it was sleepy sleepy
 <vance> I would have gone to bed early 
 <vance> And been responsible
 <vance> Now I'm gonna play games all night 
 <torr> ð is actually called eth (Þ, þ are thorn) and eth represents only the voiced th sound as in "this" or "that". Thorn can make either the voiced or unvoiced sound, like "thing" and thorn is the one that eventually became the "y" in "ye olde"
 <michael> i appreciate ðe clarification
 <torr> So Níðhöggr is pronounced Nith- (i sounds like ea in eat and th as in the) huggr (with the u as in fur, but more throaty)"
 <torr> Or you can just say Nidhogg 
 <jacob> Neetheugerre

 <michael> should be fine
 <vance> Stop appropriating 
 <taylor> Atom bombs arent even the best ones
 <michael> Happy Tuesday friends 
 <vance> What a sweet comic 
 <jacob> So in the course of about 30 seconds, I just saw a man doing circles in the crosswalk on a child sized bicycle, smoking a cigarette or joint or something; a lady probably like 9 months pregnant crossing the street about 30 ft from the crosswalk, and a dude casually wearing a weird gas mask or face plate thing

 <torr> It's the same shot for halfway through the line then it cuts mid-sentence and she says the other thing
 <taylor> When coke girl dies she dies but we see her wake up in alt tl where she gets adrenaline

 <torr> Get your hair did like this
 <ian> My hair grows straight as an arrow
 <angel> http://f.tqn.com/y/mensfashion/1/S/4/6/1/95829958_10.jpg
 <angel> Get that haircut
 <taylor> That seems reasonable for straight hair
 <nina> I think it's too windy for a hike 
 <ian> This is nuggets last visit :(
 <nina> I said goodbye to her on Tuesday
 <nina> Cried a lil heh
 <ian> She will be missed
 <nina> The green cuisine is doing a cray cray delivery deal, 3gs of shatter for 57.5
 <nina> If anyone is interested lmk
 <ian> Wtf less than 20 per gram 
 <nina> Yep
 <nina> Such a deal!
 <ian> I don't think anyone has a rig tho if I did I would definitely 
 <hunter> Pre movie hangout will start at - bring snacks if you would like so we can have a nice munchie spread! I'll be providing lots of popcorn and possibly will be picking up pizza! *Movie: Trainspotting, will start at around 8
 <vance> Probably have to pass today doing new year's stuff
 <ian> I'll be over between those times
 <hunter> Cool! Have a good time Vance. Any one else coming tonight? 
 <taylor> Ill be there corey might
 <ian> Lmao my mom asked if I would #CalExit and I said yes and she said it would be stupid without any reason why
 <vance> Same thing happened to me at lunch today after my lion dance show hahaha
 <vance> What would we do if Us sent army tho
 <ian> That's even dumber
 <jacob> I'll be over before the movie begins and hopefully in time to chill for a bit too
 <torr> What would the country do if the army was ordered to shoot at californians?
 <jacob> Depends if the populace and military were properly brainwashed and subordinate or not
 <jacob> Probably refuse
 <jacob> Altho there would be the DEFENDERS OF THE CONSTITUTION
 <jacob> I'd be more worried about anti-secessionists that don't want to abandon their homes and allegiance
 <jacob> I think we'll definitely be at war in ~6 months and be facing right wing death squads definitely
 <jacob> But as long as we have YouTube and Twitter, the revolution will never be completely vanquished
 <jacob> Thing is, the movement needs a strong leader or it will fail entirely. I'm thinking someone like Alec Baldwin or Ellen Degeneres
 <jacob> I'm thinking that things would not go smoothly and we would devolve into tribes. Like I would go to war with everyone from Berkeley, for example. Silicon Valley will become independent and be patrolled by automated death robots. Humboldt would overgrow and accessing it would become impossible (some speculate druid involvement. Strange smoke signals noted.) In LA and stuff literally everyone would turn LGBTQ and there would be 0 reproduction but also Hollywood would finally be destroyed. Sacramento remains in the union. 
 <jacob> Actually California would be retaken by Mexico, forget all of that
 <ian> That's it? 
 <jacob> Yeah
 <jacob> I ran the numbers
 <torr> California conquered by Mexico; to serve as large-scale marijuana producing state
 <taylor> Getting donut holes be over soon hunter
 <torr> #calexit
 <jacob> Actually, may have added a "5" in there. Disregard

 <vance> How is he on the drunkenness so far?

 <vance> Tay be over in 2
 <taylor> Ok
 <torr> We're here
 <ian> Thank you boys for coming over. The pleasure was all mine 
 <torr> I mean, I had a lot of pleasure too (wink)
 <torr> (Nachos)
 <ian> Sleep well lads
 <jacob> Bless
 <vance> Twas a tite nite
 <jacob> 4 zure
 <ian> Hoss is in bed with me I couldn't be more blessed 
 <vance> How bout that Superbowl boys?
 <vance> Goooooo team!
 <ian> Is it really 
 <vance> Yeah today is soupbowol Sunday
 <vance> I think it's falcos vs magas
 <ian> Magas?
 <vance> Patriots
 <torr> What if they were called the Nationalists instead? 
 <torr> Herein lies the true praxis of political correctness. The connotation of patriotism is positive and nationalism is negative. You only ever hear Americans referred to as patriotic and foreigners are always nationalistic. Political correctness is not "don't call people the n-word", it is this subtle manipulation of public sentiment.
 <vance> Wow beautiful analysis 
 <vance> If you were a student in 50 years
 <vance> Studying the age of social media 
 <vance> I would give you a +C
 <vance> Great but you didn't make word count 
 <torr> This is where the very real method by which political correctness is utilized lies. The feeling one gets of the word patriotism is goodly and the feeling one gets from the word nationalism is detrimental to the feelings of the reader. The only time one ever hears Americans talked about is when they are called patriotic and people from other countries across the globe are only talked about as being nationalistic. Political correctness is not just little common speech mannerisms such as "don't call people the n-word", political correctness is this almost unnoticeable control of public sentiment and the superstructure by the ruling class.
 <torr> Is that better?
 <torr> I made it like twice as long and less clear so I think I'll get a better grade this time
 <vance> Wow wunderbar
 <vance> I've never thought about that until now 
 <vance> Similar to how the white shoot em up boys are never called terrorist?
 <torr> Exactly
 <torr> Also there are no poor people in America, just the "suffering middle class"
 <ian> Too real too early
 <torr> Just watch some foobol
 <taylor> Petition to rename the patriots to the nationalists 
 <torr> Aye
 <angel> lets model a car as an insulating ring of line charge lambda rotating at angular velocity w
 <jacob> I can't do that right now.
 <ian> Heyyyyy
 <ian> Man I'm just trying to walk dogs and work when these guys walk with me for 10 minutes trying to tell me what they do 
 <ian> So I got this
 <ian> Nice guys but they didn't know when to quit lol
 <jacob> Ah jeez
 <jacob> Not ANOTHER testament...
 <jacob> Missed class bc my car was being a poopy and then magically fixed itself while driving home
 <ian> I did that yesterday
 <vance> My classes BC I pulled muscle trying to get out of bed lol
 <jacob> Now I have to be productive in some other way ugghhh
 <jacob> Vance wtf
 <vance> Well it was last night
 <vance> I was taking nap
 <vance> And I freaked out BC I thought I was late for class
 <vance> And when I jumped out of bed 
 <vance> Something in my lower back pulled
 <vance> Now it's hard to sit lol
 <jacob> the heck
 <vance> Ya idk
 <ian> You dingus
 <vance> Every time I cough pain shoots up my back
 <jacob> Have you tried violently slamming yourself onto your back
 <vance> No but I'm trying to poo rn
 <vance> I have to lean to my left and back
 <ian> Do the back stretch where you try sucking your own ween
 <vance> Good idea
 <vance> I can give myself a blumpkin
 <ian> Not that
 <jacob> Is that a demon that is summoned when u suck ur own dong
 <ian> No that's getting a bj while pooping
 <vance> My latest obsessions are chicken tendies and potato wedgies
 <vance> Just noticed I get a free cup of them for doing a survey on my KFC receipt lol
 <ian> I've been thinking about those tendies
 <vance> Tendies are the ultimate food
 <jacob> A free cup of tendies?
 <jacob> Liquid tendies
 <ian> When do you thinks humans will only be consuming food pills and liquids 
 <jacob> Idk but I can't wait
 <jacob> No more stupid good exposé shows
 <jacob> food*
 <jacob> Dude I've been alive for like 6 years and have yet to write an e-mail
 <ian> Write one to the FDA 
 <vance> Cup of tendies 
 <ian> Can you blend it then drink it for us?
 <vance> Done
 <torr> "I didn't go to eat chicken" could mean either "I did go, but the reason wasn't to eat chicken" or "I didn't go so that I could stay home and eat chicken"
 <torr> Isn't language weird?
 <torr> Also "is not language weird" is weird
 <ian> English is weird 
 <jacob> Or also "I never left my house"
 <jacob> Or wherever you were
 <angel> to take care of these ambiguities once and for all i vote we switch from written word to detailed pictographs drawings
 <vance> Like gifs?
 <angel> no
 <angel> like this

 <vance> So I cooked bacon to mask the smepl
 <vance> #discreet
 <taylor> Uh excuse me whats a smepl?????? Ha hahahah ahahah
 <vance> I'm going to beat you up
 <jacob> you're*
 <torr> While talking about pre-modern Asia my group started talking about how imperialism led to communism as a reaction and they were all shitting on it. But I was the group observer so I wasn't allowed to talk.
 <torr> Just sitting there staring at my pocket screen
 <torr> Lock screen*
 <vance> Your life is so sad man
 <vance> You are*
 <vance> You are life is so sad
 <peter> Yo r
 <vance> I think we should have a violent movie night
 <jacob> The raid 1 & 2
 <jacob> Kung fu shoot em up
 <jacob> They're rly good
 <angel> I recommend the hunt if ur looking for a film in which mads mikkelsen does acting good once again
 <angel> Tho not terribly violent
 <michael> Where is the emphasis placed in that sentence Vance
 <michael> Are we having a night of watching VIOLENT MOVIES
 <michael> or a VIOLENT NIGHT of watching movies
 <angel> I need a pictograph for this one
 <ian> Both
 <michael> I'd prefer the latter. It's about time we started a fight club
 <vance> Violent night of watching movies
 <vance> I was thinking like a Pixar marathon 
 <michael> Spilling each others entrails with UP in the background
 <vance> Beautiful
 <angel> Alternative suggestion have a group read through of chuck Palahniuk's fight club 2 comic book series. And then fight club
 <vance> I was also thinking the matrix 
 <vance> I was just watching fight scenes
 <vance> And battle scenes 
 <vance> From war and action movies all day
 <vance> My testosterone is off the charts 
 <vance> I think violent movie mom night would be hilarious
 <vance> Also drinking wine would help us not be passed out before first movie ends
 <vance> If we are take shots the movie will be obsolete
 <michael> If moms smoked weed what would their preferred consumption method be
 <jacob> Bong ripasss
 <taylor> If u want 3 hour pump of hot masculinity and adrenaline id recommend heat w robert deniro n al pacino 
 <angel> I recommend sword of the stranger which I hear had a competent story and superb slice em up animation 
 <taylor> N my mom likes joints the most
 <jacob> Ya joints for sure
 <jacob> Heat is good, it's more atmosphere than violence though 
 <jacob> Let's just marathon naruto
 <michael> AGREE
 <michael> +SHI[PPUDEN
 <taylor> Ya lots of guns tho but more tension than violence
 <angel> Good idea
 <taylor> Naruto is too violent for me
 <vance> You should buy your mom one of those ciggy holders from the 1920s
 <vance> That flappers used
 <angel> Watch top 10 top 10 Mary to fights videos on youtube
 <angel> Naruto
 <angel> Maryto
 <vance> Just spend all night sipping wine and watching world star
 <vance> I think the entire LOTR and Hobbit set of movies is on YouTube in 5 min clips
 <vance> I started our just watching the battles
 <vance> But now I've seen like the entire battle of 5 armies
 <ian> I vote naruto
 <ian> All of kakashi's fights
 <angel> I agree
 <vance> Attack on Titan
 <angel> also naruto v pain
 <vance> There's alotta death 
 <ian> Yes Angel
 <vance> Oh in that fight to 
 <angel> lets be real pain arc best arc
 <vance> That is the last arc I finished I think
 <vance> Idk if Tobi's actually finished 
 <vance> It tied in to another thang
 <ian> Pervy Sage death is the saddest imo
 <michael> WHAT
 <michael> SPOILERS
 <ian> Tobi's isn't done 
 <ian> I'm pretty sure 
 <ian> Rip
 <angel> Naruto becomes hokage
 <ian> Catch up Mike that was like 4-5 years ago prob
 <vance> Mike when was the last time you watched Naruto?
 <ian> Idk I haven't caught up in a bit 
 <vance> When u stole my book mark you fucking bastard
 <ian> This is why we rum night
 <ian> I'll remind you
 <vance> Battle of the angst 
 <jacob> Booiioi
 <torr> Neji dies
 <ian> Lmao
 <peter> Naruto becomes samurai 
 <ian> Asuna sensei dies
 <torr> Naruto dies but then Sakura cuts him open and squeezes his heart with her bare hands
 <torr> She might have been wearing gloves, I don't remember
 <ian> She did do that tho
 <jacob> Class canceled for 3rd time already in semester
 <jacob> Have test next week somehow
 <jacob> ??
 <jacob> Also have missed 2 days on my own
 <jacob> rip
 <jacob> What we doin tonight whhhhhooooooooooo
 <ian> I'm up for hang
 <vance> Busy eating burrito
 <vance> Maybe nap
 <ian> Tonight u dingus
 <ian> I'm work til 5
 <vance> Well I'm eating a burrito from 1230 to 6
 <vance> Then I might nap
 <ian> That's a big burrito 
 <ian> Pete if you see this I need the name of the place where we got those giant baby sized ones
 <hunter> He said king taco
 <ian> My hero
 <ian> We need a good beach day 
 <ian> I've been itching for it
 <vance> I'm down I want a bonfire
 <vance> Spicy FB roast tor 
 <vance> So my burrito got all greasey
 <vance> Since I bought it in Ventura and ate it in cam
 <vance> But the tortilla was so greasy that I fried it up on the pan
 <vance> And made it into a chimichanga 
 <vance> I'm a problem solver 
 <ian> Good choice 
 <jacob> Wht u finished ur burrito a solid 3 hours before estimated time. That's incredible
 <peter> Maybe burrito (hang) tonight?
 <torr> Are you roasting me where I can't even see? 
 <jacob> Ue
 <vance> Nu
 <vance> Jake
 <vance> Why do the other hobbits call frodo Mr frodo
 <jacob> Cuz he's a rich boy
 <jacob> Sam is his hired gardener
 <jacob> The other two are basically petty thieves
 <vance> Ooo
 <vance> High class hobbit
 <ian> Bilbo made dat money 
 <vance> Big Bilbo bucks
 <jacob> The Baggins were well off but yah Bilbo brought home the $$$
 <vance> Privileged ass frodo
 <vance> Makes his best friend call him Mr frodo
 <jacob> Naw Sam just wanna b whipped by his lord
 <ian> ;-)
 <jacob> Frodo don't give a shit he has a heart of gold
 <vance> Hahahahahaha
 <ian> A good hobbit he is
 <vance> Maybe I should read the books 
 <vance> But maaang
 <vance> If the movies take like 12 hrs already
 <jacob> I can't remember what merry and pippin actually did Idk if they were thieves or just poor and they liked to steal veggies
 <vance> Frodo had a long ass journey 
 <ian> The hobbit movie put the book to shame tbh
 <jacob> Ian
 <jacob> Pls go
 <vance> Battle for ur honor
 <ian> A man can have his opinion 
 <jacob> The hobbit wasnt written to be an epic journey like LOTR
 <ian> Oh shit
 <jacob> And Peter Jackson took a bunch of stuff that was written much later and added it into the story
 <ian> I meant it the other way around lmao
 <jacob> Not to mention adding rand
 <jacob> Oh
 <jacob> Lmao 
 <jacob> My blood pressure spiked and my teeth grew 6 inches
 <ian> But I agree 
 <vance> I felt it
 <ian> I read it again and instantly knew 
 <jacob> I rly wanted to love the movies. I think they were worth seeing but the pacing was so off
 <vance> I could feel my phone get hot when Jake read the msg
 <ian> I felt his hands around my throat 
 <jacob> I never got around to seeing the extended, which apparently filled some things in and made more sense (but are obviously that much longer)
 <vance> I was scared for you
 <vance> I think the Hobbit movies were lighter than I wanted it to be
 <vance> But I never read the books
 <ian> I was scared he thought the movies were better 
 <jacob> Well if they got anything right it was that
 <vance> The Hobbit books are lighter?
 <ian> The most action in the book was the dragon and that's not til the end lol
 <jacob> Tho maybe a little too goofy at times
 <jacob> It's one book and yeah
 <vance> O lol
 <jacob> The hobbit was short and light. LOTR is a dense epic bla bla
 <torr> I mean Twilight is way bigger and they fit that in one movie
 <torr> Why couldn't they do the same for the hobo?
 <ian> I would have been okay with 1 3-4 hour movie compared to 3 nearly 3 hour movies 
 <jacob> Hard to say. For starters it began with a different director (del toro) and then Jackson came over bc he didn't want it to be ruined or abandoned but ya idk
 <ian> O I didn't know that 
 <jacob> Jackson was a little too ambitious with the silmarillion stuff in that it kinda added unnecessary backstory that didn't feel very fulfilled anyway and also they added weird stuff like the dwarven love triangle which wasn't in the book at all
 <jacob> Also the cgi looked fuckin dumb a lot of the time ugh
 <michael> The Hobbit? more like we need an epic Aragorn dude so let's rename it The Thorin Oakenshield amirite 
 <ian> The cgi and editing was so silly
 <jacob> Some shit was tight tgougg
 <jacob> Like in the book when they'd going over the mountain giants it's not very detailed
 <jacob> But they were badass in the movie
 <jacob> Literal fuckin mountains bitch slapping eachother
 <ian> Lol it felt nice seeing some things visualized 
 <ian> Sauron and all of that looked real shitty 
 <jacob> Yeah that was weird
 <jacob> I heard there's a fan re-edit that is way better lmao
 <jacob> Like combined all 3 movies into 1
 <ian> Oh dang
 <ian> We should watch
 <vance> I'm down to watch
 <vance> If I were Sam I'd let the spider take frodo
 <jacob> It's 4.5 hrs including long credits
 <jacob> But just reading the changes it sounds way better lmao
 <jacob> O shit
 <jacob> I found a different 4.5 hr one
 <jacob> That is apparently better and even adds deleted scenes
 <jacob> OMFG
 <ian> Pleeaaaaassseeeeee
 <jacob> "Radically different introduction to Beorn, faithful to the source material"
 <jacob> I'm ready bb
 <jacob> And the funeral of the dwarves which was omitted
 <jacob> I
 <jacob> can't even
 <jacob> I'm crying dad

 <vance> There's a lecture about reducing nuclear arms by oliver stone and Peter kuznik end of Feb if anyone is interested

 <jacob> AUTOCORRECT DOESBT WORK WITH CAPS HAHAHA
 <jacob> You can come over if you want
 <vance> IAN
 <vance> R U DRIVING TO MY HOUSE ALRDY
 <vance> If Ian isn't on the way here for his khal drogas
 <vance> OK I'm coming over bb
 <torr> Comrade Sceneable is most woke smoll comrade
 <michael> WHOS READY FOR THE STORM OF THE CENTURY?! 
 <peter> Take some hefty toke under the rain
 <torr> https://youtu.be/NdPzSx59sqw
 <ian> I expect another one today
 <torr> I asked my dad if he needed anything from the market and he's just like, "bring me a ton of soda"
 <jacob> Train delayz time 2 blayz
 <nina> Yea
 <ian> This shit cray
 <ian> It's like driving through a hurricane 
 <torr> My dad lives in Camarillo Springs so I'm afraid it might get flooded up there
 <nina> Oh shit yeah he best be careful 
 <nina> Also 
 <torr> The fires killed a bunch of the plants so there are like mudslide warnings and what not
 <nina> I'm watching Jacobs home while he and his family are away
 <nina> Hang tonight?
 <torr> Maybe. Might have to take care of my dad
 <nina> Let me know if there's anything I can help with! My dad has a pickup truck if needed 
 <michael> Just went up the grade 
 <vance> Having dinner with Criz tonight might be free after
 <michael> People pulled over on the shoulder with hazards at various points 
 <vance> Watch out around TO
 <vance> And chesebro
 <vance> And Mulholland
 <vance> Puddles and big gust
 <michael> Felt like how people climbing Mount Everest use skeletons of past climbers as waypoints 
 <vance> Avoid left and right lanes 
 <nina> Be safe PLS
 <vance> Just got back from LA
 <vance> I'd say around chesebro and liberty city is worst 
 <vance> No building to cover gust
 <vance> Rip ppl who wear glasses
 <vance> Need glasses wipers
 <torr> Around 1 I saw a flipped sedan on the grade by the onramp from springs
 <michael> Anyone wanna go inner tubing down the grade w/ me?
 <torr> 4 sure dood
 <hunter> No kidding Ian. My silver surfer thought it would be a good idea to ride some of these sick waves! 
 <hunter> Cars pretty fucked up but ya boys all good 
 <hunter> Be carful when driving on those roads guys. Don't be affraid to like like a god damn granny driving a mile an hour
 <michael> Omg did you hydroplane? 
 <michael> Glad you're OK
 <ian> Yeah what happened??
 <jacob> Damn dude glad you're okay. Must've been pretty scary in that lil guy
 <jacob> Also I'm stuck in Camarillo lmao 
 <hunter> Yep I think i slipped and slid towards a big rig on my right and I guess my car's back wheels slid into the other lane while that was happening  because a vehicle behind me stuck my left back tire and I ended up skidding further towards the middle divider. Didn't impact the middle, atleast I don't think so. 
 <hunter> Luckily there are police and ambulance driving the freeways a ton due to the rain. An ambulance pulled up behind me almost instantly after it happened
 <ian> Damn dude that's intense. Glad you're okay and that they were there 
 <torr> Dang that's brutal man
 <torr> If you start planing try not to brake too much and just let off the gas. If you brake it makes it so your car might hop on the wake when you want the wheels to cut back down to the road surface
 <vance> Oshit glad you're ok
 <hunter> I was trying my best with that technique but I have a feeling the airflow from the big rig played a roll in the situation too. Just on a usual day the smart car gets pushed alittle when you go passed a rig or visa versa
 <ian> Yeah any time a semi passed me today it was ridiculous so I could only imagine for you
 <peter> Good job not dying
 <torr> Oh jeez I forgot you drive a smart car. Glad you're ok though
 <jacob> Hey
 <jacob> I have awoken
 <michael> For those of you who don't know my Grandma's gullbladder failed and she has sepsis (blood infection) and she's been in the hospital this past week. She just got out of surgery and there were complications. Ultimately she is okay however she stopped breathing after surgery and didn't properly come out of anesthesia. She's spending the night in the ICU and will be on antibiotics for a couple weeks. But she's gonna be okay and was able to talk to my mom which is a good sign. Send e-hugs plz ❤️
 <peter> Dang, your grandma is quite the trooper
 <peter> Ehug

 <vance> Expensive donut
 <peter> Ty kale
 <jacob> Eho
 <vance> Waho
 <jacob> Quieee
 <vance> Moweeep
 <peter> Haiweeu
 <jacob> Dubop
 <vance> Mapweup
 <angel> Onomatopeer
 <peter> Https://www.twitch.tv/pansanhansan
 <torr> This is the batshit fuckwit whose speech was shut down at Berkeley by Black Bloc defending, nay, promoting pedophilia https://mobile.twitter.com/ReaganBattalion/status/833405993006616576
 <jacob> Ah yes, the gay Catholic conservative who voyeurises BLACK COCK but regrets his sins
 <torr> Yeah this is totally the guy we should let talk at all the UCs
 <torr> https://youtu.be/QAYqxIxyRiQ
 <ian> Jason please just do it I can't be part of this
 <angel> in milo's defense he doesn't promote pedophilia he promotes consenting ephibophilic relationships if such a thing can be said to exist
 <jacob> Well he hardly even condones them
 <jacob> He's been doing a lot of,backtracking on that too, with the same excuse he always shaves it down to if it's too controversial. "I'm British it was a gaff teehee"
 <jacob> But yeah he didn't go on TV and actually say hey yeah pedophile is cool
 <jacob> Anyway his book publishing got cancelled lmao
 <angel> yea people are pretty upset about his gaffs
 <angel> i think on some level he just likes riling people up.
 <angel> in that podcast he was mainly talking about it being possible for some young boys to be capable of consenting at younger ages, mostly because he feels his relationships with older men at that age were with his consent.
 <ian> Too real
 <jacob> But later in his Facebook posting he said he used the term ""boy"" in a way that ""gays do"" and that he was referring to the are of 17 and above (the age at which he was in a consenting relationship with an older man that he viewed as healthy.)  But that clearly isn't what he said. Maybe the backtracking is because of the backlash. Pretty lame of the ""dangerous faggot"" aka warrior of free speech
 <angel> o yea he was definitely not talking about 17 year olds
 <jacob> I'm just glad he's getting shit on a bit tbh, I don't think he's strictly a pedo but rather was referring to his own experience (which is still questionable.) But I'm sick of hearing about him ever since he was riding the GamerGate shit for attention. And continued to write stupid contradictory shit while also promoting personal harassment and shit he's a fuck
 <jacob> It's pretty funny to see a bunch of conservatives still struggle to support him and the other half denounce him and one half blames the libs and it's like they are flinging poo
 <jacob> You're absolutely right that he likes to rile people up and do shit for attention. Unfortunately he has a huge audience that eats poo straight from his mouth. And has/had direct ties to Breitbart and Bannon and the bastardos
 <jacob> I wish he did something more stupid tbh this song enough of a career wrecker
 <angel> he's very flip flop it seems. i remember at one point he said he supported trump because it would destroy or reform the modern political landscape but then at the same time I'm pretty sure he legitimately supports trump
 <jacob> I read some literal Alex Jones superfan theorizing that Milo is next level troll that is a straight dude actually trying to make people dislike gays I think he was on to something
 <jacob> He has turned me against the gays.......
 <ian> But if he's accepting of gay relations between man and boy isn't he gay? Aren't we all gay?
 <ian> You have to be gay in order to be politically correct 
 <jacob> But Milo is /the/ anti-pc. So... Anti-gay?!
 <jacob> I don't think anything has ever made me think so hard. I give up
 <ian> Man makes point, man doesn't understand point, man retracts slightly from point therefore completely missing the point others point out, point is forgotten bc too stupid to think about in the first place, man wins
 <ian> This fuck is straight out of /pol/ jesus christ. I've never seen such obvious bait
 <ian> I refuse to read more 
 <taylor> So milo is just in denial abt being molested as a 13 year old right
 <angel> maybe. who knows
 <taylor> I do bc i did it 
 <taylor> Sry im gonna leave the chat now 
 <angel> it was a good kid diddling joke
 <angel> kid diddling jokes in good taste
 <angel> now there's a sentence
 <taylor> I cant say it 3 times fast 
 <taylor> Only diddlers deserve to be diddled 
 <torr> I don't care what he means to say or what he actually believes b/c other people listen to him and that's the problem
 <torr> If he gives a speech people who go aren't going "haha look at this edgy gay troll" they're going "yeah, I want to put it in kids' busts too!"
 <torr> Butts
 <torr> And that's not cool man
 <jacob> A legal alternative to pedophilia is putting it in a bust
 <jacob> (I'm sry)
 <ian> The problem is you can't differentiate from supporters who truthfully believe in what he says and the people just feeding his ego to get a lul out of it 
 <angel> I agree that is the danger tor. 
 <jacob> Headass
 <hunter> Haha rip the silver surfer
 <ian> God damn riparusca
 <jacob> Ooh shit man
 <jacob> Main body held up pretty well
 <jacob> It would seem
 <ian> For real that built in cage did you well
 <torr> Wowee those pristine windows
 <hunter> Haha the other side almost perfect, almost can't tell anything happened 
 <nina> Oh my gosh
 <nina> So happy you're okay!!!!
 <nina> (thankyou)
 <torr> I just saw Wrout running in the rain wearing a sopping wet visor
 <ian> Yo have you guys seen the movie Green Room
 <jacob> noe
 <ian> It took me by surprise 
 <ian> Don't watch trailer 
 <ian> Thriller, horror but no cheese 
 <hunter> I heard that movie was intense
 <torr> 39-64° today. Stay warm friends
 <ian> Sun's out guns out

 <ian> That's cool that they do that tho
 <torr> Gouge out my liver and splash my stomach acids in my face
 <torr> I asked a friend on a date but she's a lesbian HAHAHAHA
 <torr> All my romantic endeavors are just tragic. I'll have to tell you about them all sometime
 <ian> That's a way to find out 
 <ian> I'd love to exchange terrible experiences hahaha
 <torr> I don't know of mine are terrible, per se, but definitely tragic

 <ian> Unless you did know and forgot
 <ian> Which would be funny
 <torr> Nah I didn't know
 <ian> You could always use grindr

 <michael> https://github.com/pirate/sites-using-cloudflare/blob/master/README.md

 <jacob> The funny thing is that I could easily destroy Vance

 <vance> He said him and the 2 other ppl he's working with are trying to develop a formula to become successful at crowd funding 
 <vance> So they made that and now they're making other small things to develop it

 <nina> Sweet!
 <peter> How is everyone, where are you all currently ?
 <vance> Ya
 <peter> How's it going?
 <nina> What year did Hunter tan like crazy???!?!??
 <torr> My mom always tries to get her friends to convince me that socialism is dumb and will never happen and I get so worked up and like I actually start shaking and now I'm literally crying in the bathroom right now because I wish people weren't so stubborn and I feel sorry that they'll never get to see communism become reality
 <peter> I'm sorry
 <ian> I feel you mango
 <torr> I just want everyone to be a communism
 <taylor> Just say ur the reason trump won then moon them
 <torr> I am 100% the reason trump won and definitely not the half of the electorate that voted for him
 <taylor> No tell them they r the reason
 <peter> U r the reason
 <taylor> Personally id like to be yelled at by women abt socialism
 <vance> Personally id like any interaction with women
 <vance> U don't realize how lucky u r tor
 <vance> Very ungrateful 
 <taylor> Fr
 <peter> Fr
 <torr> I mean it was a gay man but ok
 <torr> Also not much yelling just a lot of "It's too idealistic" "people are selfish" and "you can't just pay everyone the same"
 <torr> Which, I have answers for all of those but most people just don't listen anymore once they're 50 and just say I'll grow out of it or something
 <taylor> Oic
 <taylor> Does he like argue for capitalism? 
 <torr> Fuck I'm not just some kid who just thinks free stuff is cool. I've read Das Kapital, I've read the Communist Manifesto, I've read god damn Wealth of Nations
 <taylor> My uncles been talking abt ayn rand a lot its not the best
 <torr> I mean "people are selfish and they want to earn more if they work harder" was a major point
 <torr> So I said that's what socialism is, in capitalism you have this wage system where no matter how much more you produce you get paid the same wage
 <torr> In socialism any value you produce belongs to you without some bourgeois pig skimming the cream off the top and giving you a wage instead
 <torr> Fuck Ayn Rand, not even a good writer
 <torr> Even supposing the whole selfish thing is true then socialism is the better option OK I'm done ranting to you
 <ian> I need more ranting
 <ian> Any plans today?
 <nina> Yes 
 <nina> Currently planning
 <nina> 8pm @ Hunters 
 <nina> Will be drinking 
 <nina> Nothing too too crazy but just a lil 
 <vance> Breakfast
 <ian> I expect you drunk all day
 <nina> Honestly 
 <vance> I am drunk rn
 <vance> I bought a dozen donuts holes last night but I fell asleep before I got to eat them
 <vance> So that's bfast o baby
 <ian> What kind?
 <vance> Classic glaze 
 <ian> Eat as many as you can at once 
 <vance> Probably 6
 <peter> Someone will be DD for Vance today.
 <peter> Let us know if you want to go somewhere
 <vance> Ty lol
 <vance> I drank tequila right when I woke up and immediately fell asleep again 
 <michael> http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.775331
 <michael> Time to vacate to Tel Aviv (hanukkah)
 <jacob> All the good kush is over in Palestine
 <michael> False. Israel was first to isolate THC. Israel is at the cutting edge of cannabis research. Get your facts straight Jacob. Or I'll teach you the difference between getting stoned for fun and getting stoned for real. 
 <vance> O fuck
 <michael> 420 בלייז איייייתתתת
 <jacob> no
 <torr> Getting stoned: biblical
 <jacob> just realized u said Israel as an entity isolated THC
 <jacob> HIVEMIND? YOU'RE GIVING YOURSELF AWAY SLOWLY....
 <jacob> hehhehheh...
 <jacob> And actually it was Dave of Heckidania circa 1349 who first isolated THC via alchemy and got high as fuck but he forgot how he did it! The zionist-controlled internet won't tell you this
 <michael> Here's a good read: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/17/world/middleeast/israel-a-medical-marijuana-pioneer-is-eager-to-capitalize.html?_r=0
 <michael> 1960s Tel Aviv police seized 10 pounds of weed
 <michael> Now they have the top scientist
 <michael> Also watch this hour long documentary on Dr. Mechoulam
 <michael> http://mechoulamthescientist.com/
 <jacob> I would rather play my fantasy video game, thanks
 <michael> עכשיו תשתוק goy
 <michael> "The chief scientist’s office of the Ministry of Economy has infused millions of shekels into innovative marijuana companies..."
 <michael> Did Dave of Heckidania have millions of sheckels to infuse? I didnt think so
 <peter> Lol np
 <jacob> Damn ur right. Dave sure doesn't live up to the jews in that regard
 <jacob> Hot take: israel invests millions in development of mind-numbing drug to placate the gullible, needy masses
 <michael> ששש לא מדברים על זה
 <jacob> You motherfucker... You know I can't read your jew runes!
 <michael> What's the best place for French toast nearby? Including Oxnard/Ventura
 <jacob> I haven't had French toast at a restaurant in a decade tbh. Unless it was like IHOP
 <jacob> I want to know too tho
 <hunter> Dr.mechoulam is a cool duder
 <peter> Taylor went to Joshua tree with his gf, and just now told me.
 <peter> He will be able to party though

 <vance> Tor if they can't handle you at your worst they don't deserve you at your best
 <torr> It's not that I hate the game, it's just that that game makes people hate each other

 <torr> It's based on capitalism so it makes people hate each other like capitalism

 <torr> God damn you invisible hand!
 <vance> Hahahahahahahaha
 <vance> The economics of cute girls
 <vance> Write a book tor
 <torr> This but not sarcastic
 <torr> Fun fact: the Jews invented speed dating
 <vance> #teamjew
 <torr> My mom told me the only reason she goes on facebook is to read my posts
 <torr> Which are 75% just conversations I have with her
 <nina> Your mom is the best 
 <vance> How are you feeling?
 <nina> I feel good about it
 <vance> I'm glad he finally stopped avoiding it
 <ian> Good. I hope it helps
 <vance> Just saw Logan
 <vance> Highly recommend
 <torr> Do you know if he'll be put on a registry or something? 
 <nina> I don't think he will be. Honestly pretty sure they made a deal and the DA dropped the sexual battery charge and just charged him with battery 
 <nina> Which I'm not sure how to feel about but I did tell the DA that the decision was in their hands
 <nina> I told them they should make the assessment and decide if he's the kind of convict that should be on the registry 
 <nina> But a misdemeanor battery isn't going away, it will stay on his record forever I believe 
 <nina> Like I get it, the DA has to make a deal when the ppl cooperate but idk how I feel about them dropping the sexual battery charge when what he did to me was blatantly sexual 
 <nina> I think they did it because of his age 
 <ian> I'm sure he was trying to build a case, lawyers were talking to the DA and they ended up offering him the deal compared to fighting and losing
 <ian> The odds were completely stacked against him. 20 days in jail, especially for someone like him, will be a living hell he'll have to deal with for the rest of his life. No pity will ever be felt
 <nina> That's very true... I didn't think about that 
 <nina> I already left a message for the DA so he could explain to me his thinking 
 <nina> I guess I'll know more when the DA calls back 
 <nina> Feel kinda weird :/
 <ian> I hope they can give you something. Justice system at its finest I guess. I'm sorry 
 <jacob> The fuck.. SOMETHING damn well better be on his record.  I wonder what the DA will have to say... let us know, yeah?
 <nina> Yeah
 <ian> Let's see Logan tonight
 <peter> Yeah
 <vance> I might be down to see it again lemme see if I can get everything I need to done
 <vance> I have done any work since Wednesday lol
 <vance> O today is my sister's bday
 <vance> Idk if she wants to do anything 
 <nina> I just got off the phone with the DA and he gave me a few more details about the conviction. The DA said that his young age combined with no prior offenses and a guilty plea gave the DA reason to believe he should not be subject to the registry.
 <peter> I was saying it feels a little like half justice.... you're waiting for the DA to give you the details about how long before he can try to appeal to expunge the assault charge from his record?
 <nina> I don't think he can ever appeal it but if he wanted to he could try to get it off his record (expunged) in at least 3 years but the DA isn't sure as to how long exactly he'd have to wait, he just knows it's 3 yrs at least cause he'll be on probation for 3 years 
 <ian> I was waiting to hear he was going to plea mentally disturbed or something along those lines so at least that isn't a reason. It does make sense what they decided (purely based on law) but now it comes down to will this be a wake up call for him to be a different and better person. I think the probation for 3 years will definitely test that depending on the probation itself
 <ian> I think depending on how his probation goes as well it will determine his ability to appeal getting it off of his record. Only time will tell
 <nina> Yes
 <nina> Because he essentially has like no rights 
 <nina> A cop can arrest him, search him, stop his car, frisk him, ect
 <nina> Also, if he ever contacts ANY of you guys asking about me or the case or anything having to do with the incident within these 3 yrs you gotta tell me
 <jacob> Okay. That makes sense.. Feels off in a sense but I think your reasoning is correct Nina/Ian. If he can improve and behave over these 3 years then it will be better for everyone, and if not then the law will hopefully respond correctly. 
 <nina> Cause that's a violation of his probation 
 <nina> Even if it's through a third party
 <nina> So social media/text messaging all included 
 <jacob> Gotcha.
 <jacob> Also, I might be up for Logan tonight btw
 <nina> In general just lmk if he contacts you 
 <ian> That's good to know thank you. I'm fired up so sorry if I'm continuing this unwanted shite
 <nina> No feeling is mutual 
 <peter> We are strong together. 
 <jacob> In other news, there is a COD black ops Jeep parked at coffee bean lmao

 <torr> I think it is actually inherent to the genre of music and the one with the most commanding presence of the group of people who don't know if you have my vise grips My vise grips were expropriated the same time as a whole the rest of the year over year old man I am a bit confused
 <angel> What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. 
 I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. 
 The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. 
 If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
 <torr> Here's the thing. You said a ""jackdaw is a crow."" Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. 
 <torr> If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too Also, calling someone a human or an ape? 
 <torr> It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"
 <angel> According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. 
 <angel> Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? Adam? Oan you believe this is happening? I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. You got lint on your fuzz. 
 <angel> Ow! That's me! Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! Hey, Adam. Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel? A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. Hi, Barry.
 <angel> Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. Hear about Frankie? Yeah. You going to the funeral? No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations.
 <angel> Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. Well, Adam, today we are men. We are! Bee-men. Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ....  And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today?
 <angel> I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. Wonder what it'll be like? A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
 <angel> Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!  She's my cousin! She is? Yes, we're all cousins.
 <angel> Right. You're right. At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. What do you think he makes? Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. What does that do? Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.
 <angel> Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference?
 <angel> You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
 <angel> But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
 <angel> Wait a second. Oheck it out. Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. Hey, Jocks! Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! I wonder where they were.
 <angel> I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.  Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?
 <angel> Distant. Distant. Look at these two. Oouple of Hive Harrys. Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!  I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this?
 <angel> Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. Six miles, huh? Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. Maybe I am. You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? Well, there's a lot of choices. But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! Barry, you are so funny sometimes. I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! You're gonna be a stirrer? No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. We're starting work today! Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... Is it still available? Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. What'd you get? Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. You want to go first? No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. Any chance of getting the Krelman? Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? I'm going out. Out? Out where? Out there. Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello. Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. Look at that. Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. Thank you. OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! That's awful. And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. Antennae, check. Nectar pack, check. Wings, check. Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! Ever see pollination up close? No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby."
 <peter>  (so)
 <peter> I'm on my way home.
 <torr> "Oan" lol
 <peter> I will let you know when to come over.
 <angel> its the bee movie script but every word starting with 'ca' is replaced by 'oa
 <angel> for some reason
 <torr> Chemical -> Ohemical?
 <angel> o yea
 <angel> also ooming
 <angel> i feel bamboozled
 <angel> this is not the bee movie script i ordered
 <angel> I sexually Identify as a TI-84 Plus Graphing Calculator. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of solving complex systems of equations with graphing and matrix capabilities. People say to me that a person being a calculator is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install a monochrome LCD display, 30 mm buttons and Texas Instruments branding on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Silver Edition" and respect my right to solve problems and load needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a calculophobe and need to check your RAM privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

 <angel> We found this new site called CSGO Lotto—so I'll link it down in the description if you guys want to check it out. We were betting on it today and I won a pot of like $69 or something like that, so it was a pretty small pot, but it was like the coolest feeling ever. I ended up following them on Twitter and stuff, and they hit me up and they're talking to me about potentially doing like a skin sponsorship.

 <torr> "The thing I really like about Planes is that we learn that WWII happened in the Cars universe. Which means there was a Cars Hitler, a Cars holocaust, a Cars Pacific War, a Cars D-Day, a Cars nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a Cars Rape of Nanking, a Cars Battle of Iwo Jima...
 <torr> This leads to so many important questions, like: were the Cars Little Boy and Fat Man nukes sentient? Was it a suicide mission? Are ALL Cars nuclear weapons sentient? Did Tsar Bomba have a personality?
 <torr> What kind of car was Car Hitler? A VW? A forklift?
 <torr> Was there a Cars 9/11? Were the planes hijacked, or were the planes themselves radicalized?
 <torr> I could go on
 <torr> Edit: I just realized a Cars 9/11 gives a whole new layer of meaning to the phrase ""let's roll"""

 <jacob> Save ur vital energies for tomorrow
 <torr> "The liberalism that Jones was bemoaning is really illiberalism, inasmuch as it issues repressive rules about what people should be able to say and hear." From an article about a college shouting down, locking out, and pulling the fire alarm on someone who wrote a book about "race based intelligence" and is a white supremacist.
 <torr> I say fuck em. Why should we let Nazis have a chance to spread their filth? And there's no way you'll change their mind through debate. In fact, the very act of debate admits that there is at least some legitimacy to their position
 <michael> I would punch a Nazi in the face 
 <torr> There are all these idiots in the comments going ""If he's a nazi then where's his party card hurr durr! A nazi is just anyone you don't like!""
 <torr> No, people call him a nazi because ""race based intelligence"" is what Nazis used to justify concentration camps
 <ian> Hey just hear him out! Everyone deserves to have an opinion! I'm sure he doesn't really mean it that way you're just calling him that because you don't understand!
 <torr> Your jest is indistinguishable from actual right wing propaganda and that is disgusting. 
 <ian> Oh is it now 
 <jacob> Any 1 ever used a hotdog 2 smouke weed

 <jacob> Ok. What does the Bailey's mix with? I can get some
 <torr> Irish car bombs 
 <vance> And u can make white Russian with the vodka if u want
 <vance> Not kalua but I imagine any creamer would work
 <jacob> Not kalua?
 <torr> Having thought about it, I don't actually care
 <vance> That's what's usually used with white russians
 <vance> I think idk
 <jacob> Ok yeah you wrote "not kalua" I didn't know what u meant
 <jacob> Ok Ians phone is goofin so he wants,me to tell u that we can come over starting @ 8

 <jacob> I'm gonna use your Jacuzzi again tonight ehehe
 <nina> What you guys up to?
 <nina> Good!!
 <vance> I'm gonna eat something then I'll be free
 <nina> Super excited to smoke the Belize weed
 <nina> Agj I made the bath water really hot
 <nina> And I rlly hope I don't drop my phone as I am drinking 
 <taylor> Me and ryan honna come to ninas too is ian there jacob
 <nina> Update: made it out safely but straight to the bed as I am quite drunky 
 <jacob> Yay
 <jacob> I'm @ ninas now
 <jacob> Vance where u
 <vance> Just woke up be over in a lil
 <vance> Damn that looks nice
 <vance> Where is Belize is there a time difference?
 <vance> Also so party cost $80 overall including Jake's Irish cream
 <vance> I'll charge you guys on Venmo pay up when you can I'll distribute cash to Ettore after
 <vance> I won't charge Ryan as he was guest of honor 
 <nina> We are an hour ahead of you guys 
 <nina> Oh yes guys a nice bottle of vodka here is like $100 
 <nina> It's fucked 
 <vance> Lmao don't buy import 
 <vance> Find out what's domestic there 
 <vance> There's domestic absinthe 
 <vance> U got kt
 <vance> Go hallucinate 
 <jacob> Paw prints on my windshield lol
 <peter> Howdy
 <taylor> How u
 <vance> Jacob in Belize 
 <ian> Train to Busan everyone watch
 <ian> On Netflix 
 <vance> Only if it's like snow piercer but tropical theme
 <vance> And everyone is wearing Hawaiian shirts 
 <ian> It's zombies lol
 <jacob> Korean zombies
 <torr> Anti-vax is the stupidest shit. It's like, even if it did cause autism (it doesn't) why would you rather have a resurgence of polio and smallpox and myriad other horrible, horrible viruses? Wtf
 <vance> The argument I had with a mom was that there are so few cases already but that's bc vaccines lol
 <torr> "Oh no, my one kid maybe got mild autism from a vaccine" or "Holy God, thousands of children must be put in tunes because they contracted a highly contagious virus that has destroyed their entire nervous system"
 <vance> U need vaccinations for herd immunity?? 
 <torr> Just like global warming and renewable energy there's a much bigger picture that's says "Even if you're right the alternative is so incredibly, massively terrible that you'd better do it anyway"
 <ian> It's hilarious because my bosses wife and i were talking about my brother and she leans in close and quietly asks me "did he get vaccinated as a baby...?" 
 <ian> I tried so hard to just let her go on about it until i was finally like "yeah i see what you're saying but its highly unlikely" 
 <ian> Also come over in 30
 <ian> If u guys want ofc 
 <peter> Hey Ian can you go over to my home sometime and play on my overwatch account a single competitive match
 <taylor> Make victoria do it
 <ian> Lol I will
 <vance> I just took a 4 hr nap
 <michael> "So I'm walking down the sidewalk, minding my own business, and two locals riding a golf cart pull up next to me and match my pace. One of the guys asks ""Hey bro, you need some herb?"" and makes a joint smoking gesture. ""Nah man I'm good.""   ""How about some cocaine? 50 dollars US for a gram of blow."" ""Nah I don't need any, thanks though.""  And as I turn away from them into the alley where our golf cart is parked the guy starts yelling at me  ""YOU'RE GAY! YOU'RE GAY! YOU'RE A GAY FUCKER!"" "
 <jacob> thats pretty gay of u to not buy some cocaine
 <jacob> Maybe it's considered rude to not buy some drugs from some fellows
 <vance> I mean look at it from their shoes
 <vance> Once you do it's pretty obvious Mike is a gay fucker 
 <torr> It's not the same blow
 <vance> But it's their job to sell blow, no?
 <torr> No like they were trying to sell cocaine but also sell blow 
 <jacob> My dentist just told me he thinks he would be much more efficient than the stabber guy in London today and the Aurora shooter
 <taylor> Wth hahahahahahahahahaha
 <ian> Jesus Christ what a guy
 <torr> Did he teach you any techniques? 
 <jacob> Like he started off by just talking about the guy today, how he has to be crazy, then was basically saying they're probably dumb because they are so inefficient
 <jacob> And then made a paintballing analogy 
 <jacob> Well Tory he really made me think about how easy it would be to run more than 4 people over and how once the initial gunfire is over it wouldn't be scary and it would be ez to continue stabbing or shooting ppl
 <jacob> He's not even a good dentist 
 <torr> Apparently it's illegal to sell alcohol in a ton of counties in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Kentucky. It's illegal to sell alcohol in the county where the Jack Daniel's distillery is
 <ian> You should've told him you thought he wasn't man enough to do it 
 <jacob> he's ourguy
 <hunter> Aw hot damn Mertonton you go girl 
 <hunter> What's that for?
 <jacob> "Heroes of the Dorm", basically HOTS tourney for a bunch of NA schools. Merty and his team repping U of Tennessee
 <jacob> If they win they get tuition paid or someshit
 <jacob> But his team is rly good this year
 <jacob> They just won in the 32 team bracket. If they win in the 16 they go to Vegas for the finals
 <vance> They got 3rd place last year?
 <vance> Or 4th?
 <vance> I'd be down to go to vegas
 <vance> Hotel room split like 7 ways would be p cheap
 <jacob> I don't think they made it that far
 <vance> Last year?
 <jacob> I can't remember. Maybe they did fly out somewhere, maybe top 8?
 <vance> Oya they got 3rd/4tg
 <vance> I don't think they played for 3rd place 
 <vance> Lost to Texas in semis
 <jacob> Vance what's the place hike thing

 <vance> Nina I'm so sorry

 <vance> I didn't see the one already opened

 <nina> That shits on you mang those yo tots now
 <vance> Mother fucker

 <angel> Wait was Logan really a vampire? I don't remember reading that in the original manga

 <jacob> beuatiful bodies
 <michael> "beuatiful bodies - memoirs of a serial killer by Jacob Killkids"

I need to attend a lecture for an assignment but we could check out a few presentations, whichever sound cool. Also a previous professor of mine apparently throws boomerangs every year so we might be able to check that out too.
 <jacob> Are you tired of reading the internet all day and making yourself miserable? Why not come to moorpark college multicukturjkmk
 <jacob> Are you tired of.      dogs? Why not attend Moorpark Memorial Women's Hospsch college multicukteal day

 <jacob> Have you ever wanted to attend something or go somewhere with a friend? Didn't think so. But you have a whole week to change your life for the better!
 <jacob> Does the academic environment frighten you or make you feel bored just thinking about it? You may be liable for compensation from the toy companies that made the lead infused toys you ingested as an infant, here at Moorpark College MULTICULTURAL Day?
 <jacob> Do you feel tired after reading a few short messages in your least favorite group chat? God is dead
 <angel> your words are reaching me Jacob but what if im a gay buttboy and cant make it because i attend another school

 <jacob> I don't think we'd stay very long, just check out whatever sounded best. Tbh I just don't want to drive to school for it by myself
 <jacob> Tay thats part of your culture I think on this day everyone would be very accepting, even the God dam campus police fascists
 <taylor> U r right an attack on my naked caucasian body on multicultures day would mean all out war

 <ian> He's our guy 
 <torr> Also discussed a bit about socialism. He said he had done some reading about it and liked it. But when I asked if he had read Marx he was like, "no that's communism and communism is bad" so obviously this was an incredibly difficult discussion for me
 <torr> But the girl we were talking to was pretty cute so I powered through
 <ian> Did you convince her? 
 <torr> Not sure, she was very vague and mostly just asked us questions
 <ian> At least she was involved 
 <torr> If she wasn't I would have just walked away because that dude was thick
 <torr> Not thicc, thick in the head

 <vance> Am I right tor? We've looked this up so many times 
 <michael> I just googled it

 <ian> NPR playing some BANGERZ this morning 
 <ian> Really is good Friday 
 <vance> What is good Friday
 <vance> Like what kind of ceremonies and shit u do for it
 <vance> What u celebrating 
 <ian> Man idk I'm not religious
 <vance> Ur going to hell
 <ian> It's just a phase
 <vance> Hahahah
 <torr> In the Catholic church you're supposed to fast
 <torr> Also no one can do any sacraments except baptism and you eat the Eucharist bread from Thursday instead of making new ones in church that day and everyone has to be sad until Sunday and the decorations in the church are all taken down
 <torr> I don't know what protestants do
 <ian> The more you know
 <vance> Wow sounds fun
 <torr> No it's sad because it's the day Jesus died
 <torr> Easter Sunday is the fun one because then he comes back and flies away
 <vance> Christian holidays sound like they really suck
 <torr> Says Mr. Christmas man
 <torr> Christian holidays are alright because the traditional meals are usually ham so you get to eat pork and laugh at the kosher Jews 
 <vance> Christmas isn't Christian legally hahaha
 <vance> Federal holiday 
 <vance> American
 <vance> Living the American dream
 <vance> Asian holidays bare just party all day though
 <vance> With literally a whole pork sometimes 
 <torr> Historically there used to be like hundreds of party-all-day Christian holidays but then the protestants didn't like it and to win people back the Catholics got rid of them all so now it's Christmas, Easter, and a bunch of sad ones
 <vance> Man
 <vance> Why would I be sad on purpose 
 <vance> I don't wanna do that
 <torr> Because hid literally died
 <torr> God
 <vance> That's like "o man but thanks dude"
 <vance> Gonna live happy since u died 4 it
 <vance> #blessed
 <torr> Well you do that on Easter 
 <torr> After he came back and explained himself
 <vance> Oh yeah he came back hahahaha
 <torr> Then he flew away
 <ian> Omg u dingus

 <ian> "I don't care how you make this work but I expect a full bottle in this smoothie"
 <torr> Then chug it all and pass out on the floor

 <ian> O ya how was that?  
 <torr> I think I'm going to go to UCSD 
 <ian> Awesome dude
 <jacob> O nice u were able to speak to someone? Whatd u talk abt
 <torr> They told me about how there aren't that many linguistics students but there are a lot of professors who always need research help so that'd be real cool. There's also a ton of labs so it's not just sitting drawing syntax trees all day
 <jacob> Dang, that sounds like a gr8 opportunity
 <ian> Righto boyo happy for you
 <torr> The language my grandfather spoke was called "Amánung Sísuan" by it's speakers which translates to "Breastfed Language"
 <peter> So a language learned from a parent from birth?
 <torr> It has a regular name but you would call it that like you would say "speaking the King's English"
 <peter> Which is the true language tho?
 <torr> Kapampangan
 <ian> The more you know
 <ian> Tor can you send a voice message of what it sounds like
 <torr> Magandang umaga in Tagalog Mayap a abac in Kapampangan
 <torr> The ng in Kapampangan is separate from the last syllable "an" so it's like Ka-pam-pang-an 
 <torr> The ng is like if you say mango but make the first part mon like pokemon
 <torr> And you never say good morning or good day, it's always beautiful day or beautiful morning, and to me that's maganda maganda
 <vance> Dang what other schools were you considering?
 <vance> Also UCSD is the only place you're a linguistics major?
 <torr> Yeah I mean I was kind of thinking about Santa Cruz and SB but mostly I was trying to figure out if I wanted to do linguistics or history
 <ian> Glad that professor was able to help
 <michael> This is Riley the newest member of the Fischler Family (2 hearts)

 <jacob> It was real nice. Gorgeous as usual. I didn't meet with faculty or anything but explored the campus quite a bit. Well, talked to housing/admissions people a bit
 <jacob> Downtown was cool. I liked it better during the day
 <jacob> Towns kind of a clusterfuck but it's manageable once you're used to it
 <jacob> The campus is just 2 cool tho man
 <torr> What 1 word would you use?
 <jacob> Choosing 1 word has never been a good idea
 <jacob> But Idk

 <jacob> So uhhhh people, whats up?  Thinking? Doing? Smelled anything good lately? 
 <michael>  Diagonal walker 
 <angel> Thinking about smelling my butt but I'm open to suggestions about smelling other butts if you leave me an invoice
 <angel> Nice doggo
 <jacob> Angel, I think starting with your own butt would be the safest path, before you begin experimenting with other, unfamiliar butts
 <torr> I don't think you can really appreciate other butts until you've come to understand your own
 <torr> Vance irl
 <vance> Y me
 <ian> Let it come 
 <torr> On my last day of class I learned that Jews invented communism and Hitler was right, he just shouldn't have killed people, and some Rabbi confirms it all so I should watch his 10 minute video
 <peter> Are we Russia?
 <torr> No we are the amazing capitalists who killed the Nazis but really we should have let them lived but made sure they did their genocide peacefully instead of how they did
 <jacob> Did someone literally say all of this
 <jacob> U shoulda thrown a trashcan or something
 <torr> Literally yes
 <torr> But it was the last day of class so I didn't think it was worth starting something
 <jacob> lol
 <vance> Hahahaha
 <torr> I guess I'm not going to blenders all summer 
 <torr> Alisen works there now
 <ian> Who that
 <torr> Ex
 <ian> Man if u want a smoothie you get one
 <michael> Let go of all that binds you 
 <torr> I would just be so uncomfortable.
 <torr> We don't have any problems or anything (as far as I know) but I just, like, don't want to be all uncomfortable, and that's all me
 <ian> We'll go with and stand strong for you
 <ian> Maybe freak her out a little
 <ian> Nothing much
 <torr> When I'm rollerblading?
 <peter> Yep
 <nina> Waz up dudes
 <jacob> Doing homework!!!!!!!
 <michael> I walked 500 miles today 
 <ian> Not bad
 <ian> 500 isn't that much
 <torr> Would you walk 500 more? 
 <michael> True but considering I normally only walk 400 it's quite the improvement 
 <ian> Just 8 hours worth of driving 
 <ian> Probably 10
 <ian> Depends on traffic you know? 
 <torr>  My mom's friends want to drive up and visit us at like 4 then go to medieval times for dinner
 <torr> Because they don't understand LA 
 <torr> From Arizona I think
 <ian>  Are they staying the weekend or something? 
 <torr> No idea
 <jacob> Just, consider this
 <peter> Scrom
 <jacob> Any1 want to drive a small group of bozos to a brewery so we can get drunk lol
 <jacob> IN AN HOUR
 <ian> Watching some lizards fight pretty sweet
 <jacob> that sounds tight
 <hunter> Hail-hydra.com
 <hunter> Got em
 <ian> Hey guys I have a serious question
 <ian> Do I look like a Chad?
 <angel> No
 <angel> Now help me I'm drunk and need to write an essay for my gay ethnic chicano literature class that I don't care about
 <jacob> sounds gayyy !
 <ian> HAHAHA gl Angel love you 
 <angel> Pls read the entirety of Luis Alberto urrea's "into the beautiful north" and tell me what u think
 <angel> I love u too ian
 <angel> Its very gayy j
 <jacob> He wants to go north but he actually confused north for south, it was a weird thing where he confused it one time and then kinda thought it was like that until he realized later. So the whole thing is kind of a trick or joke
 <torr> You look like the kind of person that dove people would say looks like a Chad
 <torr> Also some people
 <torr> But mostly dove people 
 <torr> I think Luis Alberto was not quite ethnically Chicano enough, although he was pretty politically Chicano. And everyone knows that he doesn't really think the north is beautiful, sooo the whole title is a bald faced lie. 
 <peter> Hey fam what's happening whats good
 <taylor> I poopies
 <torr> If I had a dollar for every time I've passed out on Jacob's floor is have at least like seven bucks
 <jacob> I can give u a pillow next time jeez

 <torr> I just had to talk to the census bureau for over an hour because my mom didn't fill out some one page report
 <torr> Had to answer questions about everyone's insurance and income and shit one at a time. I asked the guy if I could just say I don't know for like Kevin's whole insurance section, but they record the calls and he has to ask the questions one at a time
 <vance> That sounds like a fun Friday night
 <torr> He had a moderately thick Russian accent so that made it more difficult
 <michael> U sure it was real census 
 <michael> And not census double agent? 
 <torr> It was Russian interference. This is how Trump got elected; people like me talking to fake census
 <angel> Tfw u leave the apartment to go to a party but end up helping a guy build his new computer instead

 <vance> That's what it's all about 
 <vance> Honk honk
 <taylor> Why white rum
 <vance> It's what the internet says 
 <ian> White rum isnt as spicy and easier to mix 
 <ian> That's why Bacardi and stuff like that is used for mixed drinks
 <taylor> O ok iv never had white rum 
 <ian> White rum worst rum

 <torr> Who else thought the original Spy Kids was a scary movie?
 <jacob> Me
 <ian> The scariest of them all 
 <hunter> Those thumb people 
 <torr> They can just walk through walls. You can't do anything to stop them|  Also Tony Shalub with heads attached to his face (scream)
 <taylor> Spykids 1 was directed by the same director as pans labyrinth 
 <torr> Spy Kids was Robert Rodriguez, not Guillermo del Toro
 <angel> aren't they the same person
 <vance> Woah guys it's director of Pam's labrynth and spykids 1, Angel Casteñeda!
 <angel> hey everybody check out my newest masterpiece smurfs 3 in theatres now
 <vance> Is there anything you can reveal about the highly anticipated Smurfs 3
 <angel> most people don't know this but the smurfs are an actual real tribe of people located in the remote regions of the himilayas and san diego
 <torr> When will it be in my local Theatre?
 <angel> at least by the day before yesterday
 <vance> I heard of that tribe
 <vance> I think they are caller the chargers
 <angel> shhh
 <angel> no one can know
 <vance> Or shamoo??
 <vance> Whale shows aren't cool man
 <angel> shamoo recieved an honory knightship from the queen smurf back in 05
 <vance> That's abuse
 <vance>  Boycotting this film
 <angel> its ok i think shamoo's dead now
 <torr> I'm reporting you to cps, Danny Trejo
 <angel> his suffering has ended
 <angel> we're getting off track guys pls keep questions about smurf 3
 <torr> Ok did you do it south cgi or practical effects? 
 <torr>  with
 <angel> all footage is real
 <torr> What made you want to make this documentary? 
 <angel> wait i made this film? o neat
 <angel> everybody check it out on april 7
 <vance> Is it true that Smurfs are actually the size of elephants but they look small bc everything else is so big
 <angel> yea that's probably it
 <torr> Follow up: what gives Smurf their red pigmentation? 
 <angel> its weed
 <torr>  Antonio Banderas, what do you suggest we do to better understand Smurf 3 when we go to watch? 
 <angel> watch spy kids 1
 <angel> ull really get a feel for my directorial style and it really paints a picture of my head space for msurfs
 <torr>  How much space? 
 <vance> Carlos Santana, what can you tell us about the movies sound track?
 <angel> 2
 <angel> that goes for both questions
 <vance> Amazing 
 <angel> yea its no coincidence
 <vance> He said 2
 <vance> And said "both"
 <vance> And both refers to 2
 <torr>  Orlando Bloom is truly amazing
 <vance> And the 2 is how many questions were asked
 <angel> this goes deeper than anyone knows including me
 <taylor> They r the same guy guillermo del angel master of horror  
 <angel> I'm guillermo del torro? i always knew it that's why i made spy kids 1
 <taylor> Its like how shakespeare is multiple ppl 
 <taylor> What was it like working with the thumbs
 <angel> the thumbs were great we drank together and i was like to mr thumb man, you could be a psychic detective or something
 <angel> he said the idea was stupid and then he went to school to get a degree in police
 <angel> check him out on usa network today with his black best friend gus
 <vance> Can you tell me me about the spin off show starting the black best friend airing on BET
 <angel> its a spin off but really its a direct sequel
 <taylor> Wow thats mindblowing no wonder lassiter kept calling him thumb freak
 <angel> wow i never noticed very good insight
 <jacob> Hellp
 <jacob> Drowng in pissf
 <angel> Drink ur way to salvation
 <angel> J don't di
 <torr> Will there be thumbs in Smurf 3?
 <angel> Np one knows they're free agents
 <jacob> I think Smurf 3 is purely more buildinh, might give us something thumb related
 <jacob> Vance are u at like Yellowstone? Did someone steal your phone and record those bears?
 <vance> I was in Sequoia
 <torr> So how many ppl want to D&D at some point in the future?
 <jacob> Possibly

 <ian>  Hi cousin Mitch
 <angel> You want to know why I love cousin Mitch? cousin Mitch is a completely self-made meme. So many other memes are based in nostalgic childrens shows, funny faces, relatable situations, or references. Not cousin Mitch. cousin Mitch is completely absurd. It's cousin Mitch, and cousin Mitch. The first person to ever upvote cousin Mitch did not do so out of recognition. The first person to ever upvote cousin Mitch did not do so because a pre-existing meme format. The first person to ever upvote cousin Mitch upvoted a meme literally pulled from the ether by sheer human creativity and willpower. cousin Mitch is evidence that humans can stare into the meaningless void of eternity and force their own meaning onto to it. I will always upvote cousin Mitch, o cousin Mitch!
 <vance> Cousin Mitch is amused

 <torr> The earth is flat | The sun is a cub | What goes up must come down | Someday we will all be crushed by the sun

 <nina> Well it can probably work with the new season but the rules would have to be tweaked slightly. We play with the original seasons, we're on season 2. I've already seen all of it but Peter hasn't. Basically there are a bunch of weird Twin Peaks symbols, icons, signature phrases, scenes, etc and we drink when they happen and it's funny because the show is so weird and obscene

 <nina> Citation for the copyright violation? 
 <nina> http://www.rmfpc.com/the-fair-use-of-anothers-trademarks/

 <jacob> Just a heads up. If ur thinking about seeing Merty, we'd be going next weekend 
 <jacob> Also hi friends
 <jacob> Good tidings to you
 <ian> (door) 
 <jacob> What's that about, Ian? Not really a fan of the cryptic messages thing.
 <ian> This is my door. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My door is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my door is useless. Without my door, I am useless. I must close my door true. I must slam harder than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will… My door and I know that what counts in home depot is not the knobs we turn, the service of our associates , nor the noise we make. We know that it is the style that count. We will help… My door is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its hinges and its frame. I will keep my door clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will… Before God, I swear this creed. My door and I are the defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life. So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy, but peace!"
 <jacob> Something about a door mayhaps?

 <ian> Should Brooke steal? 
 <ian> 1 yes 2 no 
 <taylor> Steal what
 <ian> Don't worry about it
 <ian> Fuckers I just need a single number 
 <taylor> I mean it depends
 <taylor> On what it is
 <jacob> Y ea
 <ian> There was a thrift shop and Brooke wanted clothes but didn't have cash and the woman said don't worry just come with cash tomorrow 
 <ian> And she already gave Brooke the clothes 
 <taylor> Jeez she sounds like a nice lady
 <ian> She was a crazy lady lol
 <taylor> Did she dishonor u?
 <jacob> She probably will remember Brooke's face
 <jacob> So stealing... Very dangerous...
 <ian> You guys are too practical 
 <ian> Forget I said anything 
 <jacob> Stealing from a thrift store is like the lamest thing u can steal from
 <taylor> Ya 
 <ian> HAHAHA 
 <ian> Technically it's a vintage store
 <ian> Now I have to go to the bank bc she needs cash thanks butts
 <taylor> Maybe now u will consider robbing a target like normal ppl
 <vance> Steal the clothes then donate money to the thriftshop
 <vance> Just like weed
 <hunter> I agree out of all the places you can steal from 
 <hunter> Steal from the corporate machine man 
 <ian> She didn't steaaallllll we just made a big joke about it ding dongs 
 <peter> I've been (gone)
 <peter> Now im (back)
 <ian> Cracked my two front teeth at work real bad
 <ian> I'll send pics l8r
 <vance> Lmao nice
 <vance> How'd u do it
 <ian> Taking a bent bracket off of the beams. Since it was bent it wouldn't come out and I pulled real hard then straight to the mouth
 <ian> Both front teeth are p much ruined 
 <vance> Aw jesus
 <vance> Go see an orthodontist
 <vance> Or dentist
 <vance> Idk which
 <ian> Yeah I'm at the hospital so they can fill out the incident report rn 
 <vance> Depot covers it right?
 <ian> They damn well better 
 <ian> Teeth aren't cheap
 <ian> The back of them are the worst part
 <vance> I'm pretty sure by law they have to
 <vance> Hahahahahahaha u fkn hic
 <peter> Oh goodness 
 <peter> I am very sorry to hear that my friend
 <jacob> U guys are so harsh lmao
 <jacob> That sux big time Ian, does it hurt?

 <ian> It hurts real bad
 <ian> The nerves in the back are protruding 
 <jacob> Fuuuck
 <jacob> What can be done about it?
 <jacob> Right now, that is
 <ian> Not a thing 
 <ian> Just handling work related rn 
 <torr> Face injuries fucking suck so bad
 <torr> They might just have to cut you open and move everything around 
 <ian> Hey now 
 <ian> But you're right always the worst no matter
 <ian> Bottom line teeth suck
 <hunter> Hopefully they cover some nice caps or something
 <hunter> Good thing you did it now and not like a month ago haha at least you're on their coverage
 <vance> It's gonna be like in Harry Potter when Hermione gets her teeth fixed
 <vance> But then it ends up looking better after
 <vance> Ur skipping the whole braces step
 <vance> Just get ur teeth knocked out and replace them with better ones
 <hunter> Adapt or be removed 
 <angel> O Jesus that sucks Ian
 <angel> Hopefully things will get straightened out
 <ian> The depot is probably going to try some shady shit

 <ian> Also safe travels everyone
 <taylor> Its out on netflix 
 <vance> Wtf
 <vance> I'mma download that before the cruise
 <torr> Dancer Palooza. Yay
 <peter> Lol
 <torr> (salt) (salt) (s)(a)(l)(t)
 <jacob> U meet any fime ladies tory!?!?
 <torr> Hahahahahahahahaha
 <angel> Whet you at tor?
 <angel> Where
 <nina> http://m.thecamarilloacorn.com/news/2017-08-04/Front_Page/Motorcyclist_admits_fault_in_crash_that_killed_gir.html#.WYUK3btlDqB
 <angel> I hope that helps, Nina. 
 <angel> Justice for your sister that is
 <torr> I'm on long beach 
 <ian> Justice demands retribution 
 <ian> I'm glad he decided to plea guilty 
 <ian> I hope it helps too Nina. Enjoy Belize girl
 <michael> I'm glad he changed his plea but the fact it's not a DUI conviction is bull 
 <michael> Glad he's going to prison 
 <nina> He's not going to prison 
 <nina> He's going to jail
 <nina> Unfortunately there's an important difference
 <nina> It makes me happy he plead guilty but his sentence is too leinent
 <nina> Hes not a good person and he's incredibly irresponsible. It will happen again I'm sure 
 <michael> I agree
 <michael> Is the difference between jail/prison the length of time? 
 <michael> If he gets less than a year that's horseshit 
 <michael> Will definitely be at the hearing to show support 
 <michael> Even the max time listed on the article is way too lenient for someone who's shown that degree of irresponsibility, lack of judgement and poor character 
 <nina> Jail just means a county jail, so he'd be in Ventura County Jail. Prison means gederal prison, so he'd be transferred possibly out of state, or at least to a federal prison in California, which is where most felons are sent because they've done worse crimes and such
 <nina> federal prison***
 <nina> Like if you murder someone and are convicted, you go straight to prison 
 <nina> Jail is more for like ppl commiting more nonviolent crimes or crimes that don't have super long sentences
 <nina> Federal prison is scarier I've heard. Harsher guards and less accountability and such 
 <nina> I really appreciate the support 💟 it's tough to find a balance of trying to feel good while still knowing it's not fair to my family 
 <peter> Jacob is very handsome and fabulous, and he should know that.
 <peter> You're a star
 <peter> True (man)

 <ian> I'll never forget to flush again 
 <torr> It's different when you're ay home Ian
 <jacob> Sometime left the poo in toilet. As "science experiment"
 <jacob> Just spotted an Austin Henry doppelganger at orientation. Freaky shit

 <hunter> But I don't see spaghetti on there 
 <jacob> He brain tell him baguettes are Italian in origin
 <vance> I should've used Olive garden breadsticks
 <vance> Or pizza
 <vance> Or chef boyardee
 <jacob> Ditch the bread. Eat with spoon
 <jacob> Or raw spaghetti
 <jacob> Crunchy

 <peter> Btw it's open
 <peter> To us
 <angel> I don't think anyone coming Vance

 <angel> tfw 2 young for bar so u cant even be with fellow alcoholics
 <peter> Get plastered
 <angel> gettin there
 <vance> Angel
 <angel> yea
 <vance> Why is that the governing equations for almost all physical phenomenon become a 2nd order partial order differential equation?
 <angel> because acceleration is the second derivative of position
 <angel> kinda
 <angel> at least for classical problems its always a second derivatives
 <vance> Do you think it's a natural thing or is it just like the way we approximate things 
 <angel> idk exactly
 <angel> but its a good question
 <angel> a lot of things are second order differential equations
 <angel> i would assume it's a lot because of using newton's law
 <angel> lets see a list of second order diff equations
 <angel> laplace's equation for potentials
 <angel> any mechanical problem
 <angel> heat equation
 <angel> wave equation
 <angel> and a lot of these come from newton's law
 <angel> wave equation's derived from newtons laws
 <angel> im drunk rn i can't exactly answer
 <vance> Oooo ty for prompt response 
 <ian> Angel what do you think about Musks underground tunnels 
 <ian> Will they work? 
 <angel> idk maybe
 <angel> its musk im sure he knows things
 <jacob> Fu k elon musk
 <jacob> World collapse soon
 <angel> ^ musk is actually the antichrist and his tunnels will destroy us
 <vance> This is the plot to full metal alchemist
 <vance> The tunnels are gonna be a big ass pentagram
 <vance> And he gonna sacrifice everyone for ultimate power 
 <angel> we must defeat him by going on a long journey of self discovery
 <angel> as alchemist brothers
 <vance> I only lost and arm and leg
 <jacob> More like Elon Husk. A simple husk. His soul has departed to hell, where Satan reigns, teasing that sole for some immeasurable eternity. And yet all our souls with it
 <vance> But my poor brother angel 
 <vance> He lost his entire body
 <jacob> Elon Sole...
 <vance> I was able to bind his soul to a banana last second
 <jacob> Hi it's me ed. I'm a fucking banana lol
 <vance> An alchemist banana 
 <angel> my final form
 <vance> We're gonna get u ur body back
 <angel> i can't stand the long nights
 <angel> alone
 <angel> that actually gets me real hard

 <angel> but aint those the same thing
 <jacob> One of those is not My Duty
 <vance> What's the hap
 <ian> I'm hang after sunset Brooke and I are going to go
 <jacob> Damn you're going?
 <jacob> I jus got home and finished some shit

 <nina> @Ian Hunter says do whatever you want 
 <vance> If u guys r gonna have a brew I'll have a brew 2
 <vance> Hunter I want to lick every mirror in your house 
 <torr> Do you make the s sound with your tongue tip up or down?
 <ian> Down 
 <vance> Down
 <vance> I cant even do it up without a lisp
 <ian> Even a slight change up changes it
 <hunter> Pretty much more Up than down for me because I had a speech impediment and that's how they taught me to get around it 
 <torr> Apparently it's like a 50/50 split in the US which way you do it
 <torr> I go up
 <torr> If I try to go down I feel like I have a lisp (shrug)
 <vance> Weird
 <torr> How do you do your sh though?
 <torr> Or z
 <vance> Same thing 
 <vance> I lisp when my tongue is up
 <jacob> I do it up dawg
 <torr> What's up dawg?
 <torr> Oh shoot 
 <jacob> Dude... You goofed so hard
 <michael> I go down for all (s, z, Sh)
 <jacob> I go up for sh, down (i think) for s, down for z
 <nina> I'm up
 <torr> "If the liberal shock troops deem local Republicans “Nazis” — because some of them support the duly elected Republican president..." ok I'm not liberal but they're labeled Nazis because they wave swastika flags and wear SS uniforms, not because they like Trump
 <ian> If people can generalize it as the "liberals are calling all of the alt-right Nazis" then it deluds the actual fight against Nazis
 <torr> It's not a boy who cried wolf thing, they are literally Nazis and they've always been Nazis
 <torr>  No one's saying all republicans are Nazis, just that they've always worked with Nazis and now that they come out as Nazis reps refuse to acknowledge it
 <hunter> (dumb)
 <torr> I'm at wades wines what specialty alcohol do I buy?
 <torr> Any variety
 <jacob> Wine
 <jacob> Wade's
 <torr> They have over 100 beers on tap in the tasting room
 <ian> Sounds like heaven 
 <ian> Or hell
 <michael> Buy Everclear 
 <torr> Diplomatico Reserva Exclusivo rum
 <torr> Drake's brewing imperial stout and Telegraph reserve wheat beer
 <torr> For going away party guys
 <torr> The rum is basically a higher shelf version of what I got you for your bday Ian
 <ian> It looked familiar
 <michael> Looks like some 👏👌good👌👅shit🔥🔥
 <torr> The hard part is going to be not drinking it until then 
 <vance> Likely going to woodvic/dispensary today
 <vance> If anyone wants to join or needs anything 
 <jacob> Lamb birb
 <peter> I might join 
 <peter> Anyone want to register at planet fitness today?
 <vance> I'm thinking maybe 2ish of that fits in ur sched 
 <vance> U want weed Jake?
 <peter> It fits
 <peter> Im off at 2
 <vance> Wow perfect 
 <peter> Im like 50 percent
 <peter> Ill keep you up dated
 <vance> Kk
 <ian> Not drogo running w u guys but gym tomorrow morning
 <ian> Also beach tomorrow
 <ian> Then fight
 <vance> I will be at a beach front property tmrw
 <vance> Aka work
 <vance> Also it's gonna be v hot bring ur skin protectors and lots of water/cervesa 
 <ian> Too bad we don't get a hurricane
 <ian> T>ioioooioo
 <vance> Hope McGregor can break maywethers dumass defense
 <vance> Hoping it's not 12 rounds of stamina training 
 <ian> It's the best offense v the best defense really
 <ian> When are you off? 
 <vance> I think defense will always in in boxing though 
 <vance> 1030
 <ian> Fuq 
 <vance> Boxing is so limited so you don't have to defend a lot of your body
 <vance> And the striking is somewhat predictable 
 <vance> It's how he beat paq
 <ian> I hope it drags on but is intense all the same 
 <ian> I want a long fight 
 <ian> And ya that's what I can't stand 
 <vance> Defense till round 12 then win by decision
 <vance> Camp gatka till 10
 <ian> That's how you win 
 <vance> Ya but it's not cool lmao
 <ian> Back into work
 <vance> Maywether is a camper 
 <vance> Have fun
 <corey> @PeteyPeteZ 
 <torr> Bareknuckle boxing is actually way safer than with the gloves and a lot more interesting to me
 <torr> But it's illegal
 <vance> Is it safer for the person receiving the punch or giving the punch?
 <vance> The old fashion boxing stance they do in loonytoons and stuff actually utilized open palm strikes rather than knuckles I think
 <vance> I don't actually have a source for that
 <torr> Safer as in less people get concussions, break bones, or die
 <torr> They get more cuts and stuff
 <vance> O interesting I had no idea
 <vance> What's the reasoning behind that?
 <torr> The freaking huge gloves
 <corey> The damage from concussions comes from getting hit after being concussed
 <torr> They punch the head less too because you could break your own hand
 <torr> So people naturally just don't do it as much bareknuckle
 <corey> In amateur fights/the olympics they use 16 oz gloves and head gear
 <corey> Fights are also only 3-4 rounds so its much faster paced
 <torr> Excellent point
 <jacob> I keep losing each fist fight with massive blows to my head over and over again
 <hunter> If there's anyone here who loved breaking bad I highly recommend checking out Ozark on Netflix. It's SO damn good 
 <torr> Catch: no Bryan Cranston
 <hunter> Haha live from the home of haircuts we are on scene with Mike, Mike how ya doin

 <vance> Did u have any hopes for deathnote movie
 <torr> I didn't expect it to be like the show but I expected it to be watchable
 <torr> At the end there are two super bad cheesy lovey dovey scenes in slow motion with Chicago's "I don't want to live with out your love" playing over it in true garbage 80s high school movie fashion

 <michael> https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/06/plastic-fibres-found-tap-water-around-world-study-reveals
 <michael> My tap water guzzling days are finally catching up to me..
 <jacob> I warned you... Remember.. I was like Mike, we don't drink the tap water. No, seriously, that's why we have the other water. Its all the plastic fibres, Mike. And you laughed....
 <jacob> Btw pete/Nina I have the carb cap here if u find urself looking for it
 <jacob> O also if anyone wanted to throw some dosh my way to help pay for the liquor from rite aid, would appreciate it. If u feel u already contributed enough by other means, I agree. Vance need not apply
 <michael> Good news is the plastic is so small (diameter of 10 microns) that even modern water treatment techniques are ineffective! Woo! And it's in bottled water too! And the air! And sea salt! And we don't know the ramifications on the human body yet! Are they small enough to slip into our organs? Are any potential toxic chemicals capable of entering our bloodstream? Is it accumulating in our food supply too (i.e. biomagnification)? We don't really know! And scientists have had trouble finding a control group of humans that HAVEN'T been exposed to the microplastics! Isn't pollution AWESOME?
 <michael> Happy Saturday everybody 
 <jacob> We must consult the tribes of Papua New Guinea
 <jacob> I mean kidnap them and do blood test

 <nina> We could just smoke and hang a lil don't need to drank if you don't want
 <nina> Smoke shop closes at 10 DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO I'm so bad at deciding to buy things

 <torr> My dresser is arranged as a stack. How can I get it to function more like a queue?
 <michael> Simple, saw your dresser in half so you have two stacks. One dresser is your IN dresser and one is your OUT dresser. You'll put all new clothes into the IN dresser. If your OUT dresser is completely empty, you'll refill it by popping each peice of clothing out of your IN dresser and pushing it into your OUT dresser. To take clothes out of your new beautiful queue-dresser, you'll pop and return the top peice of clothing from your OUT dresser.
 <michael> here's a diagram:
 <michael> that'll be $2800 flat fee for the design schema and i can recommend you a carpenter for the implementation
 <michael> and here's a quick working demo, free of charge:

 <jacob> I am a philanthropist giving free advice out of my 69th floor flat in Taiwan
 <michael> all of my designs are insured by an LLC, don't have to worry about any technical debt likely accrued by that schmucks design
 <michael> you know what they say about free advice....
 <torr> I can probably get some guy in India to do it cheapet
 <michael> yes but can that indian guy connect it to the internet? can that indian guy make it into a new social network? exactly
 <torr> Go on...
 <torr> What's the pitch?
